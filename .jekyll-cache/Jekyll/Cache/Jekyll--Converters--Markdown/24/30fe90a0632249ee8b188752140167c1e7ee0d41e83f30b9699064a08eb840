I"ø<p>The Nerd makes his first ever game review, and tries to tackle Castlevania II: Simonâ€™s Quest for the NES, revealing the many flaws and issues that came with it. This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 1.</p>

<p>In this debut from the character we now all know as The Angry Video Game Nerd, Castlevania II: Simonâ€™s Quest is The Nerdâ€™s first video game victim. Released on the Nintendo Entertainment System just a year after the first in the series, it should have been equally as acclaimed. Though as itâ€™s the focus of an AVGN video, there are of course numerous shortcomings which prevent Simonâ€™s Quest from hitting the same highs as the original Castlevania.</p>

<p>With horrendous day to night transitions, having to throw holy water everywhere you go, and possibly the easiest boss in video game history; Simonâ€™s Quest was the perfect place for The Nerd to start dissecting the crappiest games known to man.</p>

<p>Although The Nerd may have a lot to rant about when it comes to Simonâ€™s Quest, the Castlevania series as a whole (Particularly Castlevania IV on the Super Nintendo) do hold a special place in his heart. And as a four part Halloween special in 2010, The Nerd revisits Simonâ€™s Quest, along with numerous other titles in the series.</p>
