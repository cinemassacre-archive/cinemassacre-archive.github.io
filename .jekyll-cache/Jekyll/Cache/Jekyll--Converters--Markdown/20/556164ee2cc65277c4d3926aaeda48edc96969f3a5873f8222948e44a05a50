I"∆<p>I was so pleased with ‚ÄúSnix: The Return‚Äù that I decided to do one more sequel, so I could call the whole thing ‚ÄúThe Snix Trilogy‚Äù. I tried to make this one the grand finale, however I put too much thought into it. The story was too complex and had to broken up into four more sequels which I eventually called The Six Snix Flicks. (See 98 filmography for Rotten Corpse of Snix, Possessed Mask of Snix and finally The Evil Spirit of Snix.)</p>
