<p>As you probably know, I get an overwhelming amount of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091114225953/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/Nes_Nerd/gallery/">AVGN fan art</a> sent to me on a daily basis. I try to update it once a month, but still I canâ€™t keep up with it.</p>

<p>So hereâ€™s the deal. ScrewAttack.com staff are taking care of it. If you want to send fan art, send to NerdFan@ScrewAttack.com where it can be viewed at
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091114225953/http://screwattack.com/AVGN/FanArt">http://screwattack.com/AVGN/FanArt</a>.</p>

<p>https://web.archive.org/web/20091114225953/http://screwattack.com/AVGN/FanArt</p>

<p>But if youâ€™d like ME to see it and possibly include it in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091114225953/http://cinemassacre.com/AVGN/gallery/Selected_Gallery/">selected gallery</a>, you may send me a copy at TheCinemassacre@yahoo.com. But due to high volume of email, just please donâ€™t expect a response. I appreciate all the fan effort, itâ€™s truly amazing, but sorry I canâ€™t answer all your emails.</p>
