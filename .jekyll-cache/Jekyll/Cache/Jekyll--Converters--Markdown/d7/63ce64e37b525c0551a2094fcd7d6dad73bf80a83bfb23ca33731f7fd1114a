I"Ó<p>â€œThereâ€™s this old man whoâ€™s dying and he wants one last entertainment before he goes. So he gathers together all his friends, all the freaks, to give him one last big show. Itâ€™s a Freaky Freak-Show!â€ This was the opening narration for this three-act music video. Each of the three songs served as the beginning, middle and end for the story. It was the easiest movie to act in. Just wear a weird mask, dress up weird and dance around my backyard. My only cast were all my neighborhood friends who were always busy, so unfortunately, It took me a couple months to finish this simple idea and I never got more than three â€œfreaksâ€ together at the same time. That includes myself. The whole movie shows mostly individual freaks by theirselves, so I had to cut everything together to try and create a feeling that the whole yard is full of 50 freaks. I didnâ€™t capture the insane party atmosphere as I hoped, but itâ€™s still an entertaining feast for the eyes.</p>
