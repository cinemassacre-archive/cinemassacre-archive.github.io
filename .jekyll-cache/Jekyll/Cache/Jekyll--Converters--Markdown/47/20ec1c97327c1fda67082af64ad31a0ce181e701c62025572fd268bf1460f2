I"<p>One day, my friend Brian was so bored, he picked a cluster of flowers off a tree and shoved the whole thing down his throat. Immediately, the idea for this movie came about. If he didn’t mind eating those flowers, I was sure he wouldn’t mind munching on some more. “The Herbivore” has no plot and no purpose, except to depict a peaceful day in the life of a human herbivore who dwells in the forest and eats weeds, leaves and flowers. A trilogy was planned, “The Carnivore” and “The Omnivore”, but neither were filmed.</p>
