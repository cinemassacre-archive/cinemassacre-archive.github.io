<p>The Nerd reveals how some console add-ons were never worth owning, as he takes a look at the Sega CD ‚Äì an add-on for the Sega Genesis ‚Äì and finds out what the games made for it are like. This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 25.</p>

<p>In the late 1980s, Nintendo was working on CD-based add-on for the current console, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. While initially partnering with Sony, they later tried it out with Philips. Even after both deals went south for Nintendo, Sega decided to try out the same kind of peripheral for their own system, the Sega Genesis (also known as the Sega Mega Drive). The first few years of the Sega CD seemed hopeful, with games that featured famous film actors and full-motion video. Initially, some people saw it as an evolution for video games, due to the games‚Äô advanced graphics and high production values. It wasn‚Äôt long after the Sega CD was released, however, that people started realizing how unnecessary the add-on really was. Because the device was so unusual, it was hard to develop more ‚Äúnatural‚Äù video games, which is resulted in a slew of games known as ‚Äúinteractive movies.‚Äù</p>

<p>In this episode, the Nerd will delve into the library of the Sega CD and see why it was such a commercial failure. He‚Äôll cover many titles, some of which are classic genres you‚Äôd expect on the Genesis, while others are failed experiments at making a movie out of a video game.</p>

<p>Even after all of financial trouble Sega suffered, they had no intentions to kill off the Genesis so quickly. Check out the next episode to see the even more controversial add-on, the ill fated Sega 32X.</p>
