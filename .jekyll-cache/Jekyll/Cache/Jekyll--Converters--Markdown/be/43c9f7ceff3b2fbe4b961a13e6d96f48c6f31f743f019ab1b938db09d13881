<p>Also I made some updates on my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://cinemassacre.com/AVGN/Nes_Nerd_Linx.html">links</a> page. Thereâ€™s been 3 new mentions lately and several other requests for interviews in my inbox. If youâ€™re waiting, sorry itâ€™s taking so long. Iâ€™m really struggling to catch up with things.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://www.digitpress.com/images/store/080223_news2.jpg">Article in Herald News by Ed Beeson, following my appearance at Digital Press store.</a>
Digital Press was awesome. Itâ€™s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://digitpress.com/">gaming store in Clifton, NJ</a>. I stopped by, greeted a lot of fans. Bought some retro games and was interviewed on the spot for the Herald News along with store owner Joe and also with Brett (â€œCaptain Sâ€ of PBC Productions).</p>

<p>Iâ€™m very behind on the fan art. Itâ€™ll get updated sometime soon, I canâ€™t say when. My main priority is getting the videos done. But itâ€™ll be relatively soon.</p>

<p>Also got some shirts sent in the mail by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://combobreaker.com/">ComboBreaker.com. Very cool, checkâ€™em out.</a></p>

<p>And Iâ€™ve added another fan cover of the AVGN theme song by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://www.mathowlett.com/ears/nerdtune.mp3">Mat Howlett</a></p>

<p>The biggest news I have, as far as my own personal projects go, there will be a 20-25 minute documentary coming soon entitled CineMassacre 200. Itâ€™s my 200th movie and is my own retrospective on how I got started making films and how my hobby evolved. It will be posted on YouTube soon.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s all for now. Nerd signing out.</p>
