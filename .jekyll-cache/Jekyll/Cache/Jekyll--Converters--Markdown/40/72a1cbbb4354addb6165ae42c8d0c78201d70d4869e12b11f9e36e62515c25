    <p>Ambitious but brainless production about child Ghostbusters who must combat evil spirits. Nice ideas and high energy, but overlong with barely any story structure. Production days were scattered over 6 months and I moved to a new neighborhood in the middle of it, so not only the locations change halfway through the movie, but so does the entire cast! The ghosts were created using a special trick of mine. Drawing them and superimposing them through the camera's title display function. It was weird.

    <h2><a href="/snix">Snix</a></h2>
    
    <p>A friend of mine, Phil, was over my house, so I decided to have him act in a quick improvised movie. The plot involved a demonic mask that is found harboring the soul of an ancient warlock who died in the year 1693. Now, three centuries later, he possesses Phil's body once he wears the mask. Phil had to go home, so I cloned him with a hand-puppet and finished the movie all by myself. See also: 29. SNIX: THE RETURN, 37. SNIX AGAIN, 52. ROTTEN CORPSE OF SNIX, 53.

    <p>I was so enthused about Halloween, I put together this boring disorganized mess to explore the holiday's various themes and try to get people into the spirit. It contains some mini-movies such as one where I am trapped inside a pumpkin. (a closeup of my fingers wiggling out of the jack-o-lantern's mouth) Other segments include some footage of my Halloween party, myself babbling on about classic horror films, footage of my annual Haunted House exhibit, and a music video for "Monster Mash" which actually isn't too bad. I animated several Halloween scenes such as a witch flying on her broomstick across the full moon and a Frankenstein monster rising from a laboratory table. They were all done on the Super NES Mario Paint program and to get the music on them, I had to play back everything I recorded and videotape the TV screen while playing the song on my audio tape player. I should have stacked the camera up on some books, (or heaven help me, a tripod!) but for some reason which is unknown to me today, I held the camera and it shakes like hell.

    <p>This is the first time I was serious about making a movie. I wrote a script, gathered props and casted all of my friends from the neighborhood to make this moralistic horror/sci-fi b-movie about a scientist that brings back the dinosaurs from another dimension where they supposedly departed to. My friends were not serious about acting and all they did was play around. Soon, nobody was interested in making this movie at all and it was left unfinished. I thought I'd quit making movies with live actors forever.

    <p>This marked the beginning of a new way to make movies without actors. I had no figures, toys or puppets that looked like The Wolf Man, so I just drew the whole story on paper in sequential panels like a comic book and videotaped them while playing music in the background and narrating the story. I also spoke the dialogue of all the characters, just like in all my puppet/figure films.

Unfortunatley, he can't help but dream of monsters that kill people. This is my best "illustrated" or "still" movie. (meaning it's more like a comic book that's being read for you. I draw everything and do all the voices and sound effects.)

    <p>I had a 1 foot tall Godzilla figure, so I couldn't resist making a remake of the 1954 Japanese classic monster movie. I built a city, using old toys, complete with miniature toy cars for Godzilla to pick up in his mouth and plenty of buildings for him to knock over. For the final scene where Godzilla is blown to bits, I threw in a wooden model T-rex skeleton.

My mission here was to get people to be more open minded and realize that there exist species that have not yet been verified. This documentary was put together well, but I should have scripted my narration. My improvisational speeches sounded very weak.

      <p><em>No video available.</em></p>
    
    <p>This is probably my best figure/puppet film, because the plot is appropriate for toys, because it's about toys that come to life. They awaken from my closet, without any memory of who they are, and explore my house. Along the way, they are confronted by my cat, other figures and myself. At the end, I snatch them all and put them back inside the closet. I'm the giant movie director and I use them to act in my movies, but their memory is erased each time the movie is finished. The theme of small people has been done in films like "Dr. Cyclops", "The Incredible Shrinking Man" or "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids." It's that sort of movie.

    <p>Aliens from outer space abduct a dinosaur egg, keep it alive and dormant for billions of years and then send it back to Earth, during the present time, where it's discovered by a scientific exhibition. The egg hatches and a baby velociraptor comes out and kills off the scientists. It escapes the lab and runs amuck in the city while it grows larger. There were three phases to its size. I had a baby Jurassic Park raptor figure for the infant. For the second phase, I used an adult sized raptor. For the third and final stage, I used a raptor mask and claws which were supposed to be used in the unfinished "DinoMen From D-4." I only showed the head and claws, obviously, to suggest an enormous sized creature which picks up people off the streets and eats them.

    <p>A fake documentary of myself as a tourist in Transylvania, exploring the woods, and stumbling upon the ruins of Dracula's castle. It actually took place in the woods behind my house in New Jersey, U.S.A. where there was an old stone building that was crumbling away, with vines and trees growing all around it. It's sort of a Blair-Witch kind of movie, but this was years before it.

    <p>My classic about a thief on the run who is stalked by a mysterious gang of thugs who dress up like monsters. This is the movie that got my friends to act for me again, for the first time in two years and is the one and only accomplishment of mine which truly got me started on my new path of movie making! This movie...This day was the turning point of my life! This is the film that made me realize that I was destined to become a director and since then, I have been making movies non-stop.

I grew a lot in the past year and looked completely different, but still played the same role. I used the same mask from the original which was faded, crinkled and torn. As well as it being the return of Snix, it was also the return of me, making movies again like the old days.

The competitors became more dramatic and intense when the camera was on them. At the end of the summer, I edited a greatest "hits" (all the best punches, kicks, slams, etc.) music video with the song "Eye of the Tiger." It was the FIRST EDITING JOB I've ever done!

    <p>I was hanging out in my next door neighbors' backyard one day and they said they were in the mood to be in another movie, so we made this quick improvised crime/comedy about two dumb, lazy, undercover cops who are in search of an insane, hyperactive, equally stupid, masked serial killer who's running around shooting people while hooked on a terrible potion, which he's invented to give him power. The killer stands four feet tall wearing a paper mask and sombrero! It was so funny, we had to make a sequel the next day. Both are 8 minutes long and run back to back. They're both usually referred to as the same movie. I now had an audio dubbing remote control for my camera, so this is the first movie where I dubbed in music and experimented with post-production sound effects and voices.

    <p>The killer character from "Mighty Joe Rampage" was so funny that we had to make another sequel. It begins with him escaping from a mental institution screaming his head off. Then, he goes back home, drinks his potion and goes even crazier. Just like the first movie, a second part was added. This is when another killer is introduced who wants to steal his beloved potion. The movie stopped here, because everybody was complaining about how cold the weather was. My favorite part was when Joe climbs up a chimney and then falls off!

    <p>The Halloween season was approaching, so I decided to make a series of music videos, using footage from existing monster movies. I edited them primitively using two ordinary vcr's, while playing the songs repeatedly to try and choreograph them with the film clips. After I had all my footage edited, I dubbed the songs over the footage, using my audio dubbing remote control. I did music videos for "The Monster Mash", "Ghostbusters", "The Blob", "Creature From the Black Lagoon", "The Green Slime" and an instrumental horror theme from a video game, Killer Instinct. The results are really fun to watch, considering how primitive my techniques were. People were actually in disbelief that I made this all by myself without any professional video equipment.

      <p><em>No video available.</em></p>
    
    <p>I left my audiences of "A Night of Total Terror" with an open ending. I wanted to leave it this way, so people could use their imagination to decide what happens next, but months later, I could not resist the temptation of making this sequel. I devised a more careful storyline and was ready to make my greatest movie yet, but my co-star was always unavailable, so I deleted his scenes and filmed the movie with only myself, as both the actor and camera operator. As a result, the action suffers because of no camera movement and the plot became tasteless. After this, I vowed never to make a sequel again. (besides the six "Snix" flicks) The only thing superior about this sequel is the visual side of it. I used my annual Halloween haunted house exhibit as the set and experimented with blacklights, strobe lights and a severe red floodlight to suggest the fires of hell. The shot of me crawling cross-eyed through a tunnel, covered with spiders and snakes, was classic. Another advancement in this film was my use of sound. Instead of dubbing in any music, I concentrated on spooky sound effects, such as wolves howling, coffins creaking and ghosts moaning to support what was taking place on screen. I tried my best, using two different audio tapes, playing simultaneously, to blend the sounds together and try to give them a seemingly natural flow throughout the film.

    <p>In my history class, we had to pick a philosopher, write a report and present a "visual", such as a poster, to the class. My family's background is Italian, so I chose Galilieo and made a video. I wore a beard and renascence hat to portray myself as Galileo while I spoke of my theory of gravity and threw things out my window. I added stock footage of the leaning tower of Pisa, titles, and renascence music. It was real stupid, hence my one star rating, but when we screened it in class, everybody loved it and was surprised because nobody knew I made movies.

    <p>I was so pleased with "Snix: The Return" that I decided to do one more sequel, so I could call the whole thing "The Snix Trilogy". I tried to make this one the grand finale, however I put too much thought into it. The story was too complex and had to broken up into four more sequels which I eventually called The Six Snix Flicks. (See 98 filmography for Rotten Corpse of Snix, Possessed Mask of Snix and finally The Evil Spirit of Snix.)

    <p>There's a lot of famous landmarks being destroyed or climbed in monster movies. Using footage from some of these films, I edited a little compilation, using two vcrs and dubbed my narration over it. Scenes I used included "The Deadly Mantis" climbing the Washington Monument, "King Kong" climbing the Empire State Building, alien invaders from "Earth Vs.

If he didn't mind eating those flowers, I was sure he wouldn't mind munching on some more. "The Herbivore" has no plot and no purpose, except to depict a peaceful day in the life of a human herbivore who dwells in the forest and eats weeds, leaves and flowers. A trilogy was planned, "The Carnivore" and "The Omnivore", but neither were filmed.

    <p>Another spontaneous film of mine. Joe and Ed from the neighborhood were hanging out at my back porch, bored out of their minds, so I decided to have them act in a quick spoof of "Speed"(the 1994 action thriller where a bomb is programmed on a bus to explode if the bus travels any slower than 50 mph). In "Bicycle Speed", two stupid kids are threatened by a bomb on an exercise bike that can't go above 25 mph. If they simply stop pedaling and get off the bike, they'll be safe, but they're too stupid to realize it. The "Timmy" and "Jimmy" characters they invented are hilarious. I wanted to make a series of sequels, using this comedy duo, but only one sequel was finished: 49. TIMMY AND JIMMY PLAY BASKETBALL.

As a result of this accident, strange radiation takes possession of the island and transforms the animals into monsters. The group is attacked by flesh eating snakes and giant wasps, but their worst enemy is a vicious werewolf. The movie is full of clichés. For example, Joe keeps tripping when he's running from the wolf, just like victims in slasher films always do. It was all meant to be stupid. The wolf was just a kid wearing a mask.

    <p>While taking some summer video production classes at the University of the Arts, I got to use some analog editing gear for my first time and edited a remake of one of my "Monster Music Videos" (filmography 96). This time, I was able to get the cuts just right and time it precisely with the music, the same way I envisioned it in my mind. It's chilling! This video is important to my career, because it marked the end of my amateurish in-camera editing method. Even though I had no editing gear of my own, two vcr's had to do.

    <h2><a href="/red-zombie">Red Zombie</a></h2>
    
    <p>Inspired by zombie horror classics such as "Night of the Living Dead" and "Dawn of the Dead", I wrote a script, casted my friends and made my own classic. The simplistic plot revolves around a guy who witnesses an evil sorcerer resurrect some corpses from a graveyard. Struck with fear, he runs away from this terrifying scene, but the sorcerer sends the zombies after him. The chase lasts throughout the film as he finds different weapons. He shoves a pool stick through the body of one zombie and crushes another under a garage door. "Red Zombie" was meant to be a comedy, so I exaggerated the amount of blood tremendously. For example, there's a scene where Mike lifts a zombie up to a ceiling fan. First, we see a shot of the zombie's head going up near the fan. In the next shot, we see a close-up of Mike's face grimacing as gallons of blood begin to pour all over him. We had a lot of fun making this movie, but the star lost interest halfway through production, so this movie was never finished. As a side note, it's the first movie that I shot raw and edited on my two vcr's. The title is a spoof of the 1932 Bela Lugosi cult classic "White Zombie."

Background sound effects, night shooting and serious attitude gave this little movie a chilling mood, but funny at the same time, making it a Cinemassacre cult classic.

    <p>I had a computer program called "3D Movie Maker" where you can select characters, pick locations and program them to walk about and do as you command to tell a story. I ended up making an epic action horror film which is somewhat of a remake of Red Zombie. It shares the same title as the improv, but bears no resemblance to it.

    <p>I play a guy who owns a video store full of horror movies. A masked psychopath calls up and asks if I have a movie called "Bouncing Bears From Heaven." I tell him no, but then he arrives at my door and kills me.

    <p>A music video about two kids who get so excited over a game of chess, they begin fighting with each other. The song is "Eye of the Tiger", but I changed the lyrics to describe how intense chess can be.

    <p>"There's this old man who's dying and he wants one last entertainment before he goes. So he gathers together all his friends, all the freaks, to give him one last big show. It's a Freaky Freak-Show!" This was the opening narration for this three-act music video. Each of the three songs served as the beginning, middle and end for the story. It was the easiest movie to act in. Just wear a weird mask, dress up weird and dance around my backyard. My only cast were all my neighborhood friends who were always busy, so unfortunately, It took me a couple months to finish this simple idea and I never got more than three "freaks" together at the same time. That includes myself. The whole movie shows mostly individual freaks by theirselves, so I had to cut everything together to try and create a feeling that the whole yard is full of 50 freaks. I didn't capture the insane party atmosphere as I hoped, but it's still an entertaining feast for the eyes.
