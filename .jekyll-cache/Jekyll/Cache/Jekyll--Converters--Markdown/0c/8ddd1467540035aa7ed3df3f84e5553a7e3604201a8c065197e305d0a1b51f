I"≥<p>The Nerd prepares to go all ‚Äúcowabunga‚Äù and ninja, as he reviews the game Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for the NES. This is Angry Video Game Nerd episode 5.</p>

<p>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) was one of those games that many kids wanted growing up in the 80‚Äôs. It had the characters, the action, the look, the sound and even the pizza‚Ä¶or did it? Well let‚Äôs find out how they screwed this one up.</p>

<p>In this episode the Nerd plays one of his childhood games to re-live the torment that is TMNT for the NES. He tries his best at fighting, jumping and swimming his way to defeat the insidious Shredder. Teased by out of reach pizza, taunted by impossible jumps, enraged by electric seaweed, what could possibly go wrong?</p>

<p>TMNT was released in 1989 on the Nintendo Entertainment System and developed by Konami. The game is centered on platforming action in which the player has to go through a series of Castlevania like levels to complete the game. As per Turtles fashion pizza restores life points and getting hit by enemies decreases it. Getting hit enough times knocks out the Turtle so the player has to select another until all 4 Turtles are dead.</p>

<p>Released under Konami‚Äôs Ultra Games brand, TMNT was a successful game but lacked overall quality, with glitches and unusual game design. However, due its success the game managed to get a sequel, TMNT 2, but that was a port of the original Arcade game however.</p>
