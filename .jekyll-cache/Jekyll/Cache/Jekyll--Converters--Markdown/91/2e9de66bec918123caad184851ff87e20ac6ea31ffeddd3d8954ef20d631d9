I"é<p>â€“ In episode 7 the Nerd makes fun of the McKids NES game.</p>

<p>â€“ This is the first episode where the theme song by Kyle Justin appears before the review.</p>

<p>â€“ James and I recently did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH8ewqO_ow">a panel</a> where we talked about the McKids episode. The reason we did it was we thought there was a lot of comedy potential because it was McDonalds themed. Which is true. But itâ€™s actually pretty good as far as NES games go.</p>
