I"<p>Board James loves board games enough to try one exclusively for girls: 1991′s “Electronic Dream Phone” by Milton Bradley.</p>

<p>The plastic “phone” plays prerecorded clues about the game’s stable of hunky guys. Players then use a process of elimination to determine their randomly assigned “secret admirer.” First player to guess which guy likes them is declared the winner.</p>

<p>Harmless slumber party fun? Or could James and his pals be in for a longer night than they were expecting?</p>
