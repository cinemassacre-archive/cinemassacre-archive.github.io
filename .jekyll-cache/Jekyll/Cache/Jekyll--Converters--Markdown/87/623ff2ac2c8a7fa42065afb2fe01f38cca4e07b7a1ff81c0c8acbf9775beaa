I"?<p>In my history class, we had to pick a philosopher, write a report and present a “visual”, such as a poster, to the class. My family’s background is Italian, so I chose Galilieo and made a video. I wore a beard and renascence hat to portray myself as Galileo while I spoke of my theory of gravity and threw things out my window. I added stock footage of the leaning tower of Pisa, titles, and renascence music. It was real stupid, hence my one star rating, but when we screened it in class, everybody loved it and was surprised because nobody knew I made movies.</p>
