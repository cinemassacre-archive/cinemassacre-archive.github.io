<p>about me just came to my attention. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091114225953/http://handheldwii.wordpress.com/2008/06/15/468910/#more-1481">Read it here.</a></p>

<p>This reminds me, I plan to respond to some of my interview requests by the end of the summer. I have a ton of interview requests saved in my inbox dating as far back to January. I just got real overwhelmed and was too busy to schedule anything. Mostly I’ve just been doing text-based interviews since I can do them at my leisure. But basically I just wanted to say it’s great that so many websites / radio shows want to talk to me, but I’ve just been too busy. So if you’ve been waiting, I apologize, and if you think I may not be interested, I’m just taking an extremely long time to get back to you.</p>
