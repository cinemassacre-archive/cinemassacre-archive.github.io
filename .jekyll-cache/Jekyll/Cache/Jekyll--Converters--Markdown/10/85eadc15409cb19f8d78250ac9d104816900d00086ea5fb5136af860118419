I"9<p>James was over my house one day and we playing some different NES games. He was looking through my NES collection and found that I had a copy of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. I had never even played the game myself. But James was excited to try it out because he remembered renting it years earlier from Blockbuster Video. I let him borrow that game and a few others he wanted to play. The next time I saw him, he had recorded the second episode Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (NES). In this follow up to the Simon’s Quest video, he decides to show himself on screen, to show you with his face just how much he hates the game. You’ll notice that the footage of the game isn’t even properly recorded. It’s is shot off the TV screen. The joke was that the game is so terrible, it wasn’t even worth doing correctly. Though James did a proper review of it later for episode 95 “Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde Re-Revisited”. We didn’t keep very good track of the dates on these videos at the time. But just recently found the script to this episode, which was dated June 15th 2004.</p>
