I"Œ<p>I was alone in my apartment, doing 2D Design homework, when I saw a giant cockroach. Being the country boy I am and not having any experience in the city, I had never seen a roach before. I grabbed my camera and attempted to tape it, but it escaped and I never saw it again. I ended up making a suspense movie about me looking for the roach. This was my first movie made while in college.</p>
