I"S<p>The Nerd wonders if someone framed him to tackle a bad video game, as he takes on the NES game based on Who Framed Roger Rabbit. This is Angry Video Game Nerd episode 4.</p>

<p>Who Framed Roger Rabbit was an amazing film and captured the imaginations of children and adults alike. Released in June 1988 it was a box office smash. The level of integration with live action actors and hand drawn animated characters had not been seen on this scale before. Directed by Robert Zemekis and starring Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd, and Kathleen Turner as Rogers busty wife Jessica Rabbit.</p>

<p>In this episode the Nerd takes a look at the video game adaptation of the movie for the NES. It was released in 1989 and, as is the fate of many movie adaptations ,it was an utter disappointed to many children. The game goes out of its way to make things difficult and cryptic, great for us 5 year olds at the time eh? From its notoriously bad controls and ridiculous driving stages lets watch as the Nerd sets his sights on yet another game on the list of games ruined by the dreaded rainbow: LJN Toys Inc.</p>
