<p>My film The Deader the Better, didn’t win, but “went the distance” to the first round of finalists so it’s an incredible honor just to have it seen by George Romero! It was largely influenced by the original Night of the Living Dead and a tribute to the zombie genre as a whole. I spent two years of my life making that film (the 17 minute version), building the cemetery set, all the props, and home-made special effects, so it’s nice to know that the work paid off. I thank everyone for helping out, but I also regret that there was a lot of negative feedback toward my film. It seems lots of people felt I had an unfair advantage with my internet celeb fanbase, so much that the official rules were changed. However, I’m not the only famous person to enter. There’s Teller who I’m also a big fan of. I’ve entered a lot of contests before and things always get competitive and cruel. People don’t treat others films with creative criticism. Everybody just wants to win, so they’ll do whatever they can to tear the others down. I apologize if any of my own fans did the same. I asked them to vote UP my film, not vote DOWN others. Anyway, congrats on the finalists, you can see them here. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://www.myspace.com/diaryofthedead">MySpace.com/DiaryoftheDead</a></p>
