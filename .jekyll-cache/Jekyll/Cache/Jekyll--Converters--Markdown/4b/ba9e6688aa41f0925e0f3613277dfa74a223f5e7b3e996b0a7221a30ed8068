I"-<p>A remake of the 1958 horror classic “The Blob” but with a totally different storyline about a guy who vows to turn into a blob after he dies if anybody invades his grave. I bought this slimy substance called “gak” and used it for this movie. It was fun devouring human figures with it.</p>
