I"Â<p>This is a board game thatâ€™s anything but boring!</p>

<p>Fireball Island was released by Milton Bradley in 1986.  Instead of a flat board, players traverse a three-dimensional island in search of the idol Vul-Karâ€™s jewel.  But escaping with the treasure wonâ€™t be easy.</p>

<p>Players utilize cards, bridges, caves, and tokens as they attempt to obtain the treasure.  Once they have it, they become the target of the other players.  And letâ€™s not forget the 5 - count â€˜em - 5 fireballs that can come careening down the mountain at any moment to engulf the players and put them in a smolder pit.  Then face the most harrowing challenge of them all - making your game piece fit on the boat!</p>
