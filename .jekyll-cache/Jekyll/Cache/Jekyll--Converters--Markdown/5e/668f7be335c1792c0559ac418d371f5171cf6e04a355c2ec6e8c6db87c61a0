I"ô<p>This is just ridiculous and is the first in a series starring goofy characters named Timmy and Jimmy. This is before South Park took my idea! Oh and guess what, there was NO EDITING, all the cuts were made in-camera, then the sound was dubbed in live. (that is while the VHS tape was being copied, we were redubbing our voices and the music was coming from a portable tape player.) Another piece of trivia: we made this movie the same day we did Rumble in the Jungle. Notice the same clothes.</p>
