<p>No, itâ€™s not real. Itâ€™s fan-made. Like I said in my Rocky Balboa review, the music of Survivor and the Rocky films go together like bread and butter.</p>

<p>Since 2006 marked the return of Rocky and Survivor, it would have been fitting if they included a new Survivor song in the new Rocky movie. That didnâ€™t happen, so hereâ€™s my idea of what it would have been like, and hey, itâ€™s not too late for Rocky 7. Just kidding.</p>

<p>My favorite song off the album is â€œFire Makes Steelâ€, but I chose the title track â€œReachâ€ because it fit the montage the best.</p>
