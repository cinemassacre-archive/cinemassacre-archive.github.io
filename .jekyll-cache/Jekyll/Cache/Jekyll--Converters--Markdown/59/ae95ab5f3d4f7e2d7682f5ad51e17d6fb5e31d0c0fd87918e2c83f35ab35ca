I"€<p>There were hardly any long takes in my movies, because I was always cutting. While it controls the pace and keeps the excitement level up, editing can also lend to some falsity. When two shots are cut together, everybody knows that the two incidents did not actually occur at the same time. Long takes can seem more realistic, because the action is continuous. Everybody knew I was a good editor, so I wanted to try something different, a movie without any editing. This is like a remake of Alfred Hitchockâ€™s Rope and Edgar Allan Poeâ€™s Tell Tale Heart, both combined. Unlike Rope, rather than shooting it mostly from a theatrical viewpoint, I moved the camera around constantly. The plot involved two colleagues who murder someone in their apartment and have to hide his body when unexpected guests arrive. Throughout the film, they grow increasingly nervous as guilt overwhelms them.</p>
