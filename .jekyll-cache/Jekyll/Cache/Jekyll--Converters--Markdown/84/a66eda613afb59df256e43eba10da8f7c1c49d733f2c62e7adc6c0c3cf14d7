I"y<p>There’s already a music video for King Nothing, but I never saw it, so I decided to make my own. I inserted some shots of Metallica concert footage, but most of it consisted of a king (my next door neighbor’s little sister) having a bad temper and crashing through cardboard brick walls. This video was the most challenging editing job I’ve yet done, at the time.</p>
