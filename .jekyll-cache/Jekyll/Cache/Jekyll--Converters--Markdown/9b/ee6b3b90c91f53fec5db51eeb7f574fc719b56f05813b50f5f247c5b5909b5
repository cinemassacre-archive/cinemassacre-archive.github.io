<p>I finished this film a year ago, but wasnâ€™t very experienced with uploading videos to the internet. Now that Iâ€™m more knowledged, Iâ€™ve re-uploaded the movie in BETTER quality and SMALLER file size! So now you can see it the way it should have been before.</p>

<p>I plan on maybe making a bigger budget feature length sequel/remake sometime hopefully in the future. For now, Iâ€™m enjoying much success as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/Nes_Nerd.html">Angry Video Game Nerd</a> and hopefully can use it to branch into my filmmaking career. I think <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/125_TDTB.mov">The Deader the Better</a> was one of my best works, so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/125_TDTB.mov">check it out.</a></p>
