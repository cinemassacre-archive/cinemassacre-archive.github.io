I".<p>For this episode, James had me pick from a stack of NES games and choose which one I wanted him to review. I picked Who Framed Roger Rabbit (NES) because I played it a lot when I was a kid. James and I sat next to each other and recorded the footage on a small LCD screen. This was before we really had a good method for recording the game footage. James remembered how funny it was to punch people with Eddie. And I showed him some of the tricks in the game. Like how to get to the secret building, and getting to Toontown.
Up until this point, these reviews were only available to watch as Quicktime files on the old version of the Cinemassacre website. And around this time, I had just heard about a new website that was getting popular called Youtube. It offered people an easier way to watch videos than having to download a large Quicktime file. So I quickly made a Youtube account called “JamesNintendoNerd” and uploaded the first four videos. (Unfortunately, I did not put much thought into the channel name and they don’t allow you to change it!)
Also, I made a Myspace page for the videos to help get them seen. That was very helpful in the early days to promote the videos. It’s funny now looking back. A world where myspace was popular and YouTube was new. Now that’s taking you back to the past.</p>
