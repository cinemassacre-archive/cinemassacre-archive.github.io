<p>Halloween is upon him, so for his nightmarish night the Nerd must review three very bad Halloween-themed video games for the Atari 2600. This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 36.</p>

<p>John Carpenterâ€™s Halloween is well regarded as one of the most influential horror movies of all time.  Released in 1978, the film unknowingly launched the career of scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis and arguably created itâ€™s own genre: the slasher.</p>

<p>The filmâ€™s success also led to something much more evilâ€¦Halloween, the video game.</p>

<p>Released by Wizard Video for the Atari 2600, the game featured horrifying acts of violence, all in glorious 8-bit graphics.  Unfortunately, the game wasnâ€™t able to live up to the filmâ€™s success.</p>

<p>On this particular Halloween night, the Nerd must survive horrible games, the Shape himself, and possibly the worst horror of allâ€¦CHILDREN!  All On The Night He Came Home!</p>
