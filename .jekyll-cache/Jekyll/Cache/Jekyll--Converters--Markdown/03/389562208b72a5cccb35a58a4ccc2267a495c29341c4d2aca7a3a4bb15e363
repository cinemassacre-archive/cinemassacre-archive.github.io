<p>Certain video games frustrate me a lot and a few of them even piss me off so much that I have to make movies about how irritating they are. For comedic effect, I take them real seriously as if I am genuinely angry about games that were made back in the 80â€™s and that they have haunted and tormented me through my adolescent years and beyond.</p>
