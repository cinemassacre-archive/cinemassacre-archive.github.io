<p>Taking a break from bad video games, the Nerd spends his time recalling his fondest memories of reading the Nintendo Power magazine. This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 33.</p>

<p>Before the Internet, there was only one source for Nintendo gaming news and pro tips- the pages of Nintendo Power magazine. Starting in 1988, the magazine kept gamers informed on the hottest scoops in Nintendo culture in its hundreds of monthly issues. Though generally reliable, it was published by Nintendo itself and sometimes served as a promotional organ in the guise of journalism.</p>

<p>All these years later, the Nerd unseals his vintage NP collection and looks back at the influential publication through the lens of hindsight.</p>
