<h2 id="new-site-updates">NEW SITE UPDATES</h2>

<p>The new improved CineMassacre.com will launch in JUNE. The site should be a little more organized by then.</p>

<h2 id="next-avgn-video-may-21st">NEXT AVGN VIDEO: May 21st</h2>

<p>Lots of people seem to be confused by the ending of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091114232448/http://www.gametrailers.com/player/34014.html">‚ÄúNES Accessories‚Äù</a>. It hints at R.O.B. the one important accessory I left out. But no, I am NOT planning a review of R.O.B. anytime soon. When I do, it‚Äôll be epic and will take a lot of time to make. For now, I‚Äôm trying to give myself a break and focus on reviewing basic games, instead of console reviews, game peripherals or giant compilations. Mark my words at the end of the video ‚Äúsave it til later.‚Äù</p>

<p>If the hat and the music didn‚Äôt clue some of you in, maybe this picture will make it more clear.</p>

<p>With the fourth Indiana Jones movie hitting theatres soon, we‚Äôre gonna take a look at the ‚Äútrilogy‚Äù.</p>
