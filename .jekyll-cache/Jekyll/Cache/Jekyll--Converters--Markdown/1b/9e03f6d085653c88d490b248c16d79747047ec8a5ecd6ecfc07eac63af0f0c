<p>I am getting married this weekend and will be on vacation for most of the month. After Thanksgiving, Iâ€™ll be catching up, which means there wonâ€™t be any updates on the site for a while. I may not even be checking emails. If youâ€™re waiting for a response, it could take at least a month.</p>

<p>Oh yes, and the new Nerd video will go up by the end of November.</p>
