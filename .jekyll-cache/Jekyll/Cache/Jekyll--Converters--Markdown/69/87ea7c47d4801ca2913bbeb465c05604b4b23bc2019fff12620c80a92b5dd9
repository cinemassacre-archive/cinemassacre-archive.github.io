I"­<p>I had an animation elective course where we I made this cut-out action epic. The characters came from magazines which I cut the limbs off of and reassembled with strings behind them to make their arms and legs movable. The star is Jim Carrey in his role as Andy Kaufman in â€œMan on The Moonâ€ cut from a newspaper ad. Throughout this insane cartoon, he engages in mortal combat with all kinds of other crazy characters.</p>
