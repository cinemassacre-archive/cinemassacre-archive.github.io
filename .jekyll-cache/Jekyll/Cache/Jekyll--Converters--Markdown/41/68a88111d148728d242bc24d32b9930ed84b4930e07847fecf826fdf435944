<p>BOTTOM LINE:</p>

<p>I thought Dark Knight was great! (4 stars)</p>

<p>I thought Batman Begins was good (3 stars)</p>

<p>However, I have several nitpicks about Batman Begins which are all addressed in the video. So if you hate me over it, please donâ€™t miss these comments.</p>

<p>BATMAN BEGINS</p>

<p>- 8:00 â€œI know Iâ€™m completely a minority on thisâ€</p>

<p>-7:50 â€œShould I voice my honest opnion? Whether you agree or notâ€¦â€</p>

<p>-4:07 â€œNow after all my complaining, you probably think I hate this movie, but no, I didnâ€™t. In fact, I was able to sit through it 3 times, which says a lot for me. What Iâ€™m doing is what you call nitpicking.â€</p>

<p>-3:35 â€œSo relax. Itâ€™s my own opinion and at least I gave my reasons. I didnâ€™t mean to bash it, but it already gets enough praise as it is.â€</p>

<p>I gave it 3 tumblers (stars) which means Good.
THE DARK KNIGHT</p>

<p>-2:48 â€œIt was pretty good.â€</p>

<p>-0:47 â€œheath Ledger did a great job.â€</p>

<p>-0:14 â€œOverall, pretty good.â€</p>

<p>I gave it 4 pencils in the eye (stars) which means Very good.</p>

<p>So what this proves is that the internet is a pathetic dictatorship. I think the Christopher Nolan Batman movies are very well made, but if you give them anything less than 5 stars, 10 out of 10, A + perfect rating, you get roasted.</p>

<p>â€œOPINIONSâ€ are neither right nor wrong. Go look it up in the dictionary.</p>
