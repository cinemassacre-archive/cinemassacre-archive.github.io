I"Y<p>This is sort of like a remake of Alfred Hitchcock’s “The Birds”, but instead of pecking at people, the birds attack by crapping. The bird feces was made from milk and flour which was dumped from a ladder onto the star, Joe’s head. It dried in his hair and took a long time to wash out. He was a great sport about the whole thing.</p>
