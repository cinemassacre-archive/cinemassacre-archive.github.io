I"Ü<p>All of my friends from the neighborhood used to have wrestling matches on a trampoline in their backyard. It was lots of fun, so I began videotaping the fights. The competitors became more dramatic and intense when the camera was on them. At the end of the summer, I edited a greatest â€œhitsâ€ (all the best punches, kicks, slams, etc.) music video with the song â€œEye of the Tiger.â€ It was the FIRST EDITING JOB Iâ€™ve ever done! (done using two regular vcrâ€™s)</p>
