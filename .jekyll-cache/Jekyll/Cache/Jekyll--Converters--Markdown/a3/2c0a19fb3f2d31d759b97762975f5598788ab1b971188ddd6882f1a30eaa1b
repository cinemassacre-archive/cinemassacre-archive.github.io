<p>* Has it been 2 weeks? Well don‚Äôt worry, the new nerd video is in the works. Between business, personal life and other projects, it‚Äôs just been taking a while to finish. It‚Äôs one that I‚Äôve been planning for a long time, I bet you all know what it is.</p>

<p>* I‚Äôve been busy finishing a documentary that will premiere at the Philadelphia Film Festival this April. More info on that later.</p>

<p>* People keep asking what‚Äôs up with my YouTube stats. Yes, I‚Äôm fully aware. I am still the #8 Most Subscribed Channel of All Time. I have 95,479 subscribers which aren‚Äôt going anywhere, but for whatever reason, my honors aren‚Äôt showing at the very moment. I don‚Äôt know what it is, it could be just a glitch.</p>

<p><strong>HELP ME GET MY WORK SEEN BY GEORGE ROMERO!</strong></p>

<p>* I‚Äôve also been busy re-editing my 17 minute horror film, The Deader The Better, down to 3 minutes for George Romero‚Äôs Diary of the Dead contest. I know a lot of you might not be interested in horror films, but regardless, if you want to do me the biggest favor you possibly can, then please vote for my film. The contest seems a bit confusing, but I think all you have to do is rank my video (and I just send a message to the Diary of the Dead Myspace with a link to the video). The top 10 ranked films will be watched and judged by George Romero himself! In case you don‚Äôt know, he‚Äôs the great grandfather of the zombie film genre (‚ÄúNight of the Living Dead‚Äù (1968), ‚ÄúDawn of the Dead‚Äù (1978)‚Ä¶ etc.) The winning video will be featured on the Diary of the Dead DVD. Just the idea of one of my all time favorite directors taking a look at my work is a dream come true. Please help make it happen and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091113081749/http://myspacetv.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoid=27687546">vote for The Deader the Better!</a></p>
