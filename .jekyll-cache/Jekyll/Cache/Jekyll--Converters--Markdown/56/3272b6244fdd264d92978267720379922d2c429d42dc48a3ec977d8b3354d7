I"È<p>There is nothing he can love about bad video games, as the Nerd reviews M.C. Kids for the NES, a video game based on McDonaldâ€™s.</p>

<p>Released in Feb. 1992, McKids was an advert NES game from Virgin Interactive to promote McDonaldâ€™s.</p>

<p>You star as Mick and Mack (name inspired by â€˜Dickâ€™ and â€˜Macâ€™ McDonald, the founders of McDonaldâ€™s), two kids who travel to McDonaldland to recover Ronald McDonaldâ€™s magical bag from The Hamburgler.  Along the way, youâ€™ll encounter other McDonaldland mascots including Grimace, Birdie, and CosMc.</p>

<p>Even though it plays similar to Super Mario Bros. 3, there are notable differences:</p>

<p>1.  You can pick up and throw blocks.</p>

<p>2.  You can travel upside-down by running to special cogs.</p>

<p>3.  You have to collect McDonald Cards to advance to the next level.</p>

<p>AVGN, while admit that itâ€™s wasnâ€™t a terrible game, noticed the level difficulty, bugs, and the slippery controls.  Oh, and donâ€™t bother trying to attack enemies with blocksâ€¦</p>
