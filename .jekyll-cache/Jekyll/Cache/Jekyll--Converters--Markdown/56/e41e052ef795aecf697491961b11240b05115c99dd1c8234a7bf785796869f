My thirteenth movie made when I became thirteen years of age holds true to the unlucky number thirteen. It's the worst piece of shit I've ever made. It's so bad that I dont know whether to rank it as my absolute worst or best, because it is so damn hilarious! What's the plot? A retarded kid is home alone who spends all his time punching himself in the face and dancing like a chicken. Then, a green slimey monster comes into the house and tries to eat him, but he makes monkey noises at it, hits it with a whiffle ball, and then knocks its head off by ramming it with a boxing glove taped to the end of a stick.

(He also noted it as "Rating: 1 or 10?")
