I"ª<p>There was a week left before my first year of college started, so I quit my job and became extremely bored. I wanted to make one last movie before the summer ended, but nobody was available to act, as usual, so I casted my dog and two cats. I just lowered the camera level to the ground and documented their daily activities and laid the classical tune â€œBlue Danubeâ€ over it all. The results are relaxing to watch.</p>
