<p>The Cinemassacre productions teamed up with Lucky Bastard productions for the Philadelphia <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050905194136/http://www.48hourfilm.com/">48 Hour Film Project</a>. We even took an award for â€œBest Cinematography.â€ Good job, everyone. The film, written, directed, and edited in under two days, is titled â€œDeath Seenâ€, ironically after my last yearâ€™s 48 hour film, â€œThe Death Suit.â€ The genre we drew was Mystery. What we turned out was a creepy tale of a mysterious figure in black following someone, sort of like â€œThe Head Incidentâ€ (1999).</p>
