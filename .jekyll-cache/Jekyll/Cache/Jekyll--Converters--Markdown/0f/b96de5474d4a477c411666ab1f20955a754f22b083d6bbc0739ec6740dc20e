<p>Happy New Year!</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080324125629/http://www.dorkswithoutfaces.com/microshock/interviews/rolfe.html">interviewed on Micro-Shock.com</a>. Itâ€™s a good one.</p>

<p>They also reviewed my zombie film <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080106112214/http://www.dorkswithoutfaces.com/microshock/Reviews/deaderbetter.html">The Deader the Better.</a></p>

<p>Iâ€™ll also be appearing at MagFest on Friday. Iâ€™ll probably conduct a Q&amp;A or screen some Nerd videos and maybe show some new outtakes. Thereâ€™s no definite, announced time. I would say, get there early. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080226013131/http://magfest.org/">More info at Magfest.org</a></p>
