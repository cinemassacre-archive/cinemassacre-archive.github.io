I"<p>I had a “time &amp; motion” class which dealt with creating patterns and sequences in various mediums. One of the assignments we had involved shooting a video of a sequence of shots of somebody doing an action. I got carried away and made a movie about an art student who attempts to carry his heavy project, a giant mouse trap, from the classroom, back to his apartment. Along the way, he has to squeeze into an elevator. When crossing the street, pieces of the project keep dropping and he has to pick them up. People who have taken the three-dimensional design course know exactly what I’m talking about, because that’s what they have to endure. What I like so much about this video is that it’s a true story and George, the actor, appeared to be very natural.</p>
