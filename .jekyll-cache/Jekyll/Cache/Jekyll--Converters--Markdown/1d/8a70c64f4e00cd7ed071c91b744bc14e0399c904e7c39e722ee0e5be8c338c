<p>Spotlight on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011003526/http://one.revver.com/watch/373438">The Jersey Odysseys, Episode 1: LEGEND OF THE BLUE HOLE</a>. I made this film as a pilot episode for a series based on urban legends in New Jersey. This was before I gained worldwide internet fame as the Angry Video Game Nerd, so the series has been on halt for some time, but in the future, I plan on making more.</p>
