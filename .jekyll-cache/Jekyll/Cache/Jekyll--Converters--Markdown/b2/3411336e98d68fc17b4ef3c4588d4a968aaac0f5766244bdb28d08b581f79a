I"²<p>The biggest problem in making the Snix series was the availability of the actors. The Rotten Corpse of Snix was a very simple movie but it took 10 months to make. Knowing I had two more chapters to go, I couldnâ€™t stand to take any longer, so this time, I casted no actors other than myself, so there was nothing to halt the production and it was over in two weeks. The plot picks up where Snixâ€™s body has been destroyed, but his mask still exists and haunts me. This movie provided me with great editing practice, and itâ€™s technically a better movie than the last Snix flicks, but itâ€™s not one of my favorites. It feels very solitary without any other actors to liven it up.</p>
