I"ð<p>This episode features quite a treat, arguably the most brutal and unforgiving board game ever created, brought to us by the childhood mind of Board James himself.</p>

<p>Deadly Danger Dungeon!!!</p>

<p>But first, weâ€™re treated to a smattering of other self-created games from Jamesâ€™ childhood.  We go to space, cause mayhem in a neighborhood, steal jewelry, and even get a glimpse at the ORIGINAL Street Fighter 3!</p>

<p>Mike returns to take the role of a treasure-seeker who falls into a dungeon full of spikes, rocks, and nasty traps.  Every step he takes could mean certain death, and only the luck of the dice will keep him alive!</p>

<p>Can Mike survive long enough to collect a key, a magic talisman, and escape to tell the tale?</p>
