I"„<p>I was highly interested in cryptozoology, the search for animals unknown to science, so I made this documentary about Nessie. My mission here was to get people to be more open minded and realize that there exist species that have not yet been verified. This documentary was put together well, but I should have scripted my narration. My improvisational speeches sounded very weak.</p>
