<p>In Part two of two, The Nerd takes a look at Shaq Fu for the SNES, and three bad games for the Wii.This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 39.</p>

<p>The Nerdâ€™s knee-jerk misanthropy has come back to haunt him, as three ghosts (each strangely familiar in their own way) have come to show him the terrible track his life is on.</p>

<p>A dazzling tour of the Nerdâ€™s past, present and future puts his life into sharp perspective, while examining which is worse: â€œShaq Fuâ€ or yet another trite â€œChristmas Carolâ€ retread. After all, itâ€™s not like the Nerd could ever be redeemedâ€¦ or could he?</p>
