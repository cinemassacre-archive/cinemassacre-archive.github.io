I"T<p>I had a computer program called “3D Movie Maker” where you can select characters, pick locations and program them to walk about and do as you command to tell a story. I ended up making an epic action horror film which is somewhat of a remake of Red Zombie. It shares the same title as the improv, but bears no resemblance to it.</p>
