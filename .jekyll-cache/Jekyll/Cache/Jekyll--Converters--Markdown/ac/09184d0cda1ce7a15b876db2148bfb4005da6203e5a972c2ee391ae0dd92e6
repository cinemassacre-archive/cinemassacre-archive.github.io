I"#<p>In this sequel to “Bicycle Speed”, Timmy and Jimmy try to have a nice game of basketball, but it turns into a childish battle of name calling and face slapping. The improvised dialogue was hilarious. Joe’s line “I wanna clean your mom’s butt with a toothpick and thread”, was so funny that you can hear me choking back my laughter. This was my first movie shot using my new VHS camera. I also found that using it as a vcr, I could make clean looking cuts with it, though they were still tricky to time, if you know what I mean.</p>
