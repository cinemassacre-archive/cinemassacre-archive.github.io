<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=MunkyCheez">Munky Cheez channel added to YouTube</a>. Warning: if you show it to your kids, they’ll go crazy and say “Munky Cheez!” non-stop. That’s proven.</p>

<p>I tried to make them more child friendly on the YouTube account. For the UNCENSORED versions, find them on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/animation.html">movies page</a>.</p>
