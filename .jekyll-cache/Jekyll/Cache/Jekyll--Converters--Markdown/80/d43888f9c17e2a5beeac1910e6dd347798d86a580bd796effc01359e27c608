    <h2><a href="/spirit">Spirit</a></h2>
    
      <p><em>No video available.</em></p>
    
    <p>Ambitious but brainless production about child Ghostbusters who must combat evil spirits. Nice ideas and high energy, but overlong with barely any story structure. Production days were scattered over 6 months and I moved to a new neighborhood in the middle of it, so not only the locations change halfway through the movie, but so does the entire cast! The ghosts were created using a special trick of mine. Drawing them and superimposing them through the camera's title display function. It was weird.

      <p><em>No video available.</em></p>
    
    <p>Inspired by Tim Burton's two Batman movies, I decided to make the next sequel on my own using Batman figures. This movie is just as much fun as watching a little kid playing with toys, whichever way you want to look at that.

    <h2><a href="/smogo">Smogo</a></h2>
    
      <p><em>No video available.</em></p>
    
    <p>Heavily inspired by Godzilla, I decided to make a series on my own, about a monster. I used a dinosaur figure with movable jaws and limbs as my star. The plot again revolved around people who venture to a mysterious island.

    <p>Smogo returns to demolish the city again, along with three other monsters, until a good creature convinces him to become a hero. Just like Godzilla, Smogo fights off the other beasts and saves civilization. What's funny is that Smogo talks.

    <p>In this fourth and final chapter in the Smogo series, Smogo is given a son and together they must battle a monster made of Rocks who wants to take over the island and become king. Interestingly, each Smogo movie was shot in one day. The four days were consecutive.

    <h2><a href="/snix">Snix</a></h2>
    
    <p>A friend of mine, Phil, was over my house, so I decided to have him act in a quick improvised movie. The plot involved a demonic mask that is found harboring the soul of an ancient warlock who died in the year 1693. Now, three centuries later, he possesses Phil's body once he wears the mask. Phil had to go home, so I cloned him with a hand-puppet and finished the movie all by myself. See also: 29. SNIX: THE RETURN, 37. SNIX AGAIN, 52. ROTTEN CORPSE OF SNIX, 53.

    <h2><a href="/house-of-horror">House of Horror</a></h2>
    
    <p>I was so enthused about Halloween, I put together this boring disorganized mess to explore the holiday's various themes and try to get people into the spirit. It contains some mini-movies such as one where I am trapped inside a pumpkin. (a closeup of my fingers wiggling out of the jack-o-lantern's mouth) Other segments include some footage of my Halloween party, myself babbling on about classic horror films, footage of my annual Haunted House exhibit, and a music video for "Monster Mash" which actually isn't too bad. I animated several Halloween scenes such as a witch flying on her broomstick across the full moon and a Frankenstein monster rising from a laboratory table. They were all done on the Super NES Mario Paint program and to get the music on them, I had to play back everything I recorded and videotape the TV screen while playing the song on my audio tape player. I should have stacked the camera up on some books, (or heaven help me, a tripod!) but for some reason which is unknown to me today, I held the camera and it shakes like hell.

      <p><em>No video available.</em></p>
    
    <p>This is the first time I was serious about making a movie. I wrote a script, gathered props and casted all of my friends from the neighborhood to make this moralistic horror/sci-fi b-movie about a scientist that brings back the dinosaurs from another dimension where they supposedly departed to. My friends were not serious about acting and all they did was play around. Soon, nobody was interested in making this movie at all and it was left unfinished. I thought I'd quit making movies with live actors forever.

      <p><em>No video available.</em></p>
    
    <p>I decided to go back to my puppets. When I made my remake of the classic horror tale, I stuck close to the original 1818 novel by Mary Shelley and suprisingly not the 1931 movie.

    <h2><a href="/james-rolfes-animation-creations">James Rolfe's Animation Creations</a></h2>
    
    <p>I took some Saturday animation classes at the University of the Arts and made a series of cut-out cartoons which featured people fleeing from dinosaurs, knights sword-fighting through castles and castaways exploring dangerous jungles. Though they're rushed and choppy-looking, they're fun to watch.

      <p><em>No video available.</em></p>
    
    <p>This marked the beginning of a new way to make movies without actors. I had no figures, toys or puppets that looked like The Wolf Man, so I just drew the whole story on paper in sequential panels like a comic book and videotaped them while playing music in the background and narrating the story. I also spoke the dialogue of all the characters, just like in all my puppet/figure films.

    <h2><a href="/deadly-dreams">Deadly Dreams</a></h2>
    
      <p><em>No video available.</em></p>
    
    <p>Tale of a boy who is chosen by an evil wizard to bring forth the destruction of the world. A black spell is cast while he sleeps which causes all of his dreams to come true. Unfortunatley, he can't help but dream of monsters that kill people. This is my best "illustrated" or "still" movie. (meaning it's more like a comic book that's being read for you. I draw everything and do all the voices and sound effects.)

    <h2><a href="/the-twilight-zone">The Twilight Zone</a></h2>
    
      <p><em>No video available.</em></p>
    
    <p>Self made nighmarish sequence which shows me wandering about my house encountering bizarre apparitions at every turn. Bares no relation to the classic TV series, but uses the music. This is the first movie in which I added music after the video was shot. I played the movie with my camera pointing toward the TV screen and re-recorded it while my tape player played the music next to the camera.

      <p><em>No video available.</em></p>
    
    <p>I had a 1 foot tall Godzilla figure, so I couldn't resist making a remake of the 1954 Japanese classic monster movie. I built a city, using old toys, complete with miniature toy cars for Godzilla to pick up in his mouth and plenty of buildings for him to knock over. For the final scene where Godzilla is blown to bits, I threw in a wooden model T-rex skeleton.

      <p><em>No video available.</em></p>
    
    <p>A remake of the 1958 horror classic "The Blob" but with a totally different storyline about a guy who vows to turn into a blob after he dies if anybody invades his grave. I bought this slimy substance called "gak" and used it for this movie. It was fun devouring human figures with it.

    <h2><a href="/the-loch-ness-monster">The Loch Ness Monster</a></h2>
    
      <p><em>No video available.</em></p>
    
    <p>I was highly interested in cryptozoology, the search for animals unknown to science, so I made this documentary about Nessie. My mission here was to get people to be more open minded and realize that there exist species that have not yet been verified. This documentary was put together well, but I should have scripted my narration. My improvisational speeches sounded very weak.

    <h2><a href="/the-giant-movie-director">The Giant Movie Director</a></h2>
    
      <p><em>No video available.</em></p>
    
    <p>This is probably my best figure/puppet film, because the plot is appropriate for toys, because it's about toys that come to life. They awaken from my closet, without any memory of who they are, and explore my house. Along the way, they are confronted by my cat, other figures and myself. At the end, I snatch them all and put them back inside the closet. I'm the giant movie director and I use them to act in my movies, but their memory is erased each time the movie is finished. The theme of small people has been done in films like "Dr. Cyclops", "The Incredible Shrinking Man" or "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids." It's that sort of movie.

      <p><em>No video available.</em></p>
    
    <p>Aliens from outer space abduct a dinosaur egg, keep it alive and dormant for billions of years and then send it back to Earth, during the present time, where it's discovered by a scientific exhibition. The egg hatches and a baby velociraptor comes out and kills off the scientists. It escapes the lab and runs amuck in the city while it grows larger. There were three phases to its size. I had a baby Jurassic Park raptor figure for the infant. For the second phase, I used an adult sized raptor. For the third and final stage, I used a raptor mask and claws which were supposed to be used in the unfinished "DinoMen From D-4." I only showed the head and claws, obviously, to suggest an enormous sized creature which picks up people off the streets and eats them.

      <p><em>No video available.</em></p>
    
    <p>A fake documentary of myself as a tourist in Transylvania, exploring the woods, and stumbling upon the ruins of Dracula's castle. It actually took place in the woods behind my house in New Jersey, U.S.A. where there was an old stone building that was crumbling away, with vines and trees growing all around it. It's sort of a Blair-Witch kind of movie, but this was years before it.

    <h2><a href="/a-night-of-total-terror">A Night of Total Terror</a></h2>
    
    <p>My classic about a thief on the run who is stalked by a mysterious gang of thugs who dress up like monsters. This is the movie that got my friends to act for me again, for the first time in two years and is the one and only accomplishment of mine which truly got me started on my new path of movie making! This movie...This day was the turning point of my life! This is the film that made me realize that I was destined to become a director and since then, I have been making movies non-stop.

    <h2><a href="/snix-the-return">Snix: The Return</a></h2>
    
    <p>I watched all of my old movies and my favorite was "Snix." To me, it was a classic, so as a joke, I decided to make its sequel after three years. I grew a lot in the past year and looked completely different, but still played the same role. I used the same mask from the original which was faded, crinkled and torn. As well as it being the return of Snix, it was also the return of me, making movies again like the old days.

    <p>All of my friends from the neighborhood used to have wrestling matches on a trampoline in their backyard. It was lots of fun, so I began videotaping the fights. The competitors became more dramatic and intense when the camera was on them. At the end of the summer, I edited a greatest "hits" (all the best punches, kicks, slams, etc.) music video with the song "Eye of the Tiger." It was the FIRST EDITING JOB I've ever done! (done using two regular vcr's)

      <p><em>No video available.</em></p>
    
    <p>I was hanging out in my next door neighbors' backyard one day and they said they were in the mood to be in another movie, so we made this quick improvised crime/comedy about two dumb, lazy, undercover cops who are in search of an insane, hyperactive, equally stupid, masked serial killer who's running around shooting people while hooked on a terrible potion, which he's invented to give him power. The killer stands four feet tall wearing a paper mask and sombrero! It was so funny, we had to make a sequel the next day. Both are 8 minutes long and run back to back. They're both usually referred to as the same movie. I now had an audio dubbing remote control for my camera, so this is the first movie where I dubbed in music and experimented with post-production sound effects and voices.

      <p><em>No video available.</em></p>
    
    <p>The killer character from "Mighty Joe Rampage" was so funny that we had to make another sequel. It begins with him escaping from a mental institution screaming his head off. Then, he goes back home, drinks his potion and goes even crazier. Just like the first movie, a second part was added. This is when another killer is introduced who wants to steal his beloved potion. The movie stopped here, because everybody was complaining about how cold the weather was. My favorite part was when Joe climbs up a chimney and then falls off!

      <p><em>No video available.</em></p>
    
    <p>The Halloween season was approaching, so I decided to make a series of music videos, using footage from existing monster movies. I edited them primitively using two ordinary vcr's, while playing the songs repeatedly to try and choreograph them with the film clips. After I had all my footage edited, I dubbed the songs over the footage, using my audio dubbing remote control. I did music videos for "The Monster Mash", "Ghostbusters", "The Blob", "Creature From the Black Lagoon", "The Green Slime" and an instrumental horror theme from a video game, Killer Instinct. The results are really fun to watch, considering how primitive my techniques were. People were actually in disbelief that I made this all by myself without any professional video equipment.

    <h2><a href="/an-evening-of-real-supernatural-horror">An Evening of Real Supernatural Horror</a></h2>
    
      <p><em>No video available.</em></p>
    
    <p>I left my audiences of "A Night of Total Terror" with an open ending. I wanted to leave it this way, so people could use their imagination to decide what happens next, but months later, I could not resist the temptation of making this sequel. I devised a more careful storyline and was ready to make my greatest movie yet, but my co-star was always unavailable, so I deleted his scenes and filmed the movie with only myself, as both the actor and camera operator. As a result, the action suffers because of no camera movement and the plot became tasteless. After this, I vowed never to make a sequel again. (besides the six "Snix" flicks) The only thing superior about this sequel is the visual side of it. I used my annual Halloween haunted house exhibit as the set and experimented with blacklights, strobe lights and a severe red floodlight to suggest the fires of hell. The shot of me crawling cross-eyed through a tunnel, covered with spiders and snakes, was classic. Another advancement in this film was my use of sound. Instead of dubbing in any music, I concentrated on spooky sound effects, such as wolves howling, coffins creaking and ghosts moaning to support what was taking place on screen. I tried my best, using two different audio tapes, playing simultaneously, to blend the sounds together and try to give them a seemingly natural flow throughout the film.
