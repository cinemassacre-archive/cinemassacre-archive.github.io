I"2<p>The Halloween season was approaching, so I decided to make a series of music videos, using footage from existing monster movies. I edited them primitively using two ordinary vcr’s, while playing the songs repeatedly to try and choreograph them with the film clips. After I had all my footage edited, I dubbed the songs over the footage, using my audio dubbing remote control. I did music videos for “The Monster Mash”, “Ghostbusters”, “The Blob”, “Creature From the Black Lagoon”, “The Green Slime” and an instrumental horror theme from a video game, Killer Instinct. The results are really fun to watch, considering how primitive my techniques were. People were actually in disbelief that I made this all by myself without any professional video equipment.
