I"¶<p>â€œThe game of battle action!â€  â€œThe realistic battle game of the Medieval Ages.â€</p>

<p>At least thatâ€™s what the box said.  Weapons and Warriors was released by the Pressman Toy Corporation in 1994.  Why they thought a game consisting of more than 75 pieces would be great for kids is anyoneâ€™s guess, but once the battlefield is set, tempers are sure to flare.</p>

<p>James and Mike (who more than earns his nickname) wage an epic war in the living room.  The battle begins one-sided as Mike controls the heavily fortified castle and superior weapons, and James controls the army out in open carpet plains.</p>

<p>Who will claim victory when the battle balls start flying?</p>
