<p>Itâ€™s Christmas, so the Nerd sees how bad a number of unlicensed religious-themed games were on both the NES and SNES, including Super 3D Noahâ€™s Ark â€“ a game built on the same game engine as Wolfenstein 3D. This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 17.</p>

<p>This Christmas, let the Nerd remind you of the Christmas spirit by throwing Baby Moses down the Nile. If you think thatâ€™s weird, just hop on Noahâ€™s Ark, where you can shoot an army of goats with sleeping pills from a slingshot. Thatâ€™s right folks, thereâ€™s nothing holy about these Bible-based boatloads of sacrilege.</p>

<p>Released in 1991 by Wisdom Tree, Bible Adventures was a game that was so poorly put together that it wasnâ€™t even sold at major video game retailers. The same could be said for their next title, Bible Buffet, a game as baffling as its title would suggest. And rounding out the trilogy is Super Noahâ€™s Ark 3D, a blatant, kid-friendly knockoff of Wolfenstein 3D that was released in 1994. Itâ€™s so bad that it wasnâ€™t even officially licensed by Nintendo!</p>

<p>Games this bad shouldnâ€™t be legal, so prepare yourself for the terror that awaits you in this episode. This just might by the Christmas that kills the Nerd! So grab your strongest cup of eggnog, because this is going to be a long one.</p>
