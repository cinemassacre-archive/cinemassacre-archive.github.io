I"<<p>In this fourth chapter of the Snix series, the long dead body of Snix is resurrected in a modern day 20th century in search of his eternal rival Xins. Once again, this sequel shows tremendous improvement over the previous installment in the series. Though, itâ€™s a bit overlong, it contains some amusing scenes, including a chase with a tractor on a public roadway and a grand finale where I sword-fight Snix and eventually cut off his head, throw the body out a second-story window, and take the head to the railroad tracks where the train actually runs it over!</p>
