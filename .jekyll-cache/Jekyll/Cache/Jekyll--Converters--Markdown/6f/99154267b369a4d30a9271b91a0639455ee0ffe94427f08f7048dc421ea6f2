<p>Second in the "Worst Video Games" series. This one covers Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde for NES, which can possibly, in my opinion, be the absolute #1 WORST game ever made. It's so bad that my voice over couldn't do it justice, so I come on-screen and beg people to stay away from this game at all costs. I take it over-the-top.</p>
