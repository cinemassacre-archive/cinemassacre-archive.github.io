I"•<p>This is probably my best figure/puppet film, because the plot is appropriate for toys, because itâ€™s about toys that come to life. They awaken from my closet, without any memory of who they are, and explore my house. Along the way, they are confronted by my cat, other figures and myself. At the end, I snatch them all and put them back inside the closet. Iâ€™m the giant movie director and I use them to act in my movies, but their memory is erased each time the movie is finished. The theme of small people has been done in films like â€œDr. Cyclopsâ€, â€œThe Incredible Shrinking Manâ€ or â€œHoney, I Shrunk the Kids.â€ Itâ€™s that sort of movie.</p>
