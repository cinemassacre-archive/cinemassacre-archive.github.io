I"≠<p>This was my first experience with using 16mm film instead of video. Visual arts majors at my school are forced to go through a ‚Äúfoundation‚Äù program where you are stuck drawing, sculpting, painting and doing everything. I had one film class for an elective and no emphasis was placed on narrative structure or editing. The only assignment was to shoot off a 3 minute roll of film on a simple action and explore the different ways to depict it, places to move the camera and lighting setups. I was the only student in the class who did a narrative and at first everybody thought I was crazy, but I pulled it off. Everybody in the class wore monster masks and had lots of fun.</p>
