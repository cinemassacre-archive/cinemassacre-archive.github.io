<p>This is a video I‚Äôve been holding onto for a while,</p>

<h2 id="avgn-dvd-link">AVGN DVD LINK?</h2>

<p>I‚Äôm getting a lot of questions about the AVGN DVD Vol 1. Why aren‚Äôt the links working? Right now, ScrewAttack is updating their site which means there will probably be a new merchandise page. As soon as they have that ready, I‚Äôll fix my links.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm also aware that some of the video links aren‚Äôt working. They‚Äôll be fixed too.</p>
