I"æ<p>Another spontaneous film of mine. Joe and Ed from the neighborhood were hanging out at my back porch, bored out of their minds, so I decided to have them act in a quick spoof of â€œSpeedâ€(the 1994 action thriller where a bomb is programmed on a bus to explode if the bus travels any slower than 50 mph). In â€œBicycle Speedâ€, two stupid kids are threatened by a bomb on an exercise bike that canâ€™t go above 25 mph. If they simply stop pedaling and get off the bike, theyâ€™ll be safe, but theyâ€™re too stupid to realize it. The â€œTimmyâ€ and â€œJimmyâ€ characters they invented are hilarious. I wanted to make a series of sequels, using this comedy duo, but only one sequel was finished: 49. TIMMY AND JIMMY PLAY BASKETBALL.</p>
