I"´<p>Tale of a boy who is chosen by an evil wizard to bring forth the destruction of the world. A black spell is cast while he sleeps which causes all of his dreams to come true. Unfortunatley, he canâ€™t help but dream of monsters that kill people. This is my best â€œillustratedâ€ or â€œstillâ€ movie. (meaning itâ€™s more like a comic book thatâ€™s being read for you. I draw everything and do all the voices and sound effects.)</p>
