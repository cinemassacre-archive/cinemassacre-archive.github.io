I"é<p>This is a parody commercial advertising an album of 13 devil worshipping songs. A devil speaks and says â€œTo order, call 1-800-666-HELL.â€ Footage of various metal bands is used while the credit crawl lists all the songs including â€œAntiChrist Superstarâ€ by Marilyn Manson, â€œHellâ€™s Bellsâ€ by AC/DC, â€œBurn in Hellâ€ by Judas Priestâ€, â€œNumber of the Beastâ€ by Iron Maidenâ€, â€œSelling my Soulâ€ by Black Sabbathâ€, â€œUnholyâ€ by Kiss, and many more! This is first in a trilogy that has not yet been made. The next two are â€œSuicideâ€™s greatest hitsâ€ and â€œJunkieâ€™s greatest hits.â€ Drugs, devil-worshipping, suicideâ€¦ the stuff that makes rock nâ€™ roll great! (This is an example of my dark sick humor.)</p>
