I"“<p>Self made nighmarish sequence which shows me wandering about my house encountering bizarre apparitions at every turn. Bares no relation to the classic TV series, but uses the music. This is the first movie in which I added music after the video was shot. I played the movie with my camera pointing toward the TV screen and re-recorded it while my tape player played the music next to the camera.</p>
