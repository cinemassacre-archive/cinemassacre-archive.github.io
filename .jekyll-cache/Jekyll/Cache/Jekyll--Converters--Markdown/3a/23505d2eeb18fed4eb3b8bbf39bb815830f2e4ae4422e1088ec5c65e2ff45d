<p>Keeping up with this stuff is a full time chore, let alone MAKING THE VIDEOS! This website, in case you donâ€™t know, is run by me alone. And for the amount of traffic Iâ€™ve gotten, which just keeps on accelerating, itâ€™s an amazing accomplishment for a shitty website run by one person! But not for long, Iâ€™m getting help.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I met with a new web designer whom Iâ€™ll introduce later. Heâ€™ll be helping me take care of this stuff, so sometime this month, we will be launching a revised CineMassacre.com. Same place, new look. Coming soon.</p>

<p>Anyway, hereâ€™s 3 updates.</p>

<p>1) Theme song covers:</p>

<p><em>â€˜Hello, I am Gavin MacLean. I am currently in the early stages of developing a new AVGN computer game! I have here some artwork I made, two video download links, one leading to a video showing the intro to the game, the other leading to a sneak peek video featuring basic game play. (Note: videos are in avi format and the sneak peek is outdated, meaning many changes have already been made since it was made) Enjoy them, I will send new stuff to the nerd when I can and if you have any ideaâ€™s for me, comments, or fan mail, send your e-mails to avgnLordGavin@yahoo.com. Enjoy!â€™</em></p>

<p>Here are the two videos:</p>
