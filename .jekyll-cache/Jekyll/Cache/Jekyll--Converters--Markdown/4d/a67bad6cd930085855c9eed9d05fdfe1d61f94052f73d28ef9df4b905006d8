<p>The Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 2! Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was a game released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1989. It was developed by Advance Communication Company and published by Toho &amp; Bandai (who also put out the Godzilla toys). It is slow moving side-scroller, with notoriously bad controls and confusing gameplay. During gameplay, you alternate between Hyde or Jekyll where you will either try to avoid taking damage or kill monsters. Dr. Jekyll is supposed to be on his way to a wedding, but on the way heâ€™s getting annoyed by people bothering him on his walk, which causes him to turn into Hyde. You can see an in-depth review of the game, when the Nerd finally reviews the game for real in episode #95 Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde Revisited</p>
