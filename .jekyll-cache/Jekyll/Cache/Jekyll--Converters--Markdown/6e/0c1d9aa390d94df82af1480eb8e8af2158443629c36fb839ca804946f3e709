I"Õ<p>Board James takes a look at Crossfire, a game largely remembered more for its hyperactive commercial in the early 90s than for the game itself.</p>

<p>The Crossfire commercial, with its in-you-face visuals and hard rock theme song, is certainly a product of the 90s. However, the game itself dates back to 1971, when it was first introduced by the Milton Bradley Company.</p>

<p>The object of the game is to shoot small metal balls into star-shaped and triangle-shaped pucks in order to knock them into your opponents goal. Sounds fun enough, but can the game itself possibly live up to the epic commercial? Introducing M0therF*cker Mike, he and Board James test this game out while paying homage to the commercial.</p>
