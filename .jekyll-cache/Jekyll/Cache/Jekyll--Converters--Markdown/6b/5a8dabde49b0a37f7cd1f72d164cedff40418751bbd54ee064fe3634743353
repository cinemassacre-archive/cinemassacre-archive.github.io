<p>Well, Happy Valentines day. The new video is up! No, it’s not holiday themed, the release date was a coincidence. It’s about the Atari 5200 console and NOT a game review, but a struggle to get the games to work.</p>

<p>Keep your mind open. It’s a little different from most of my videos, but the next few lined up are more traditional angry game reviews. This is the first Angry Video Game Nerd video of 2007! And I know the wait was long, but from here forward, I’ll be making more on a steady basis.</p>

<p>GameTrailers.com, bought Screwattack’s “Video Game Vault” videos, “Top 10” videos and the new Angry Video Game Nerd videos. So that’s where all the new videos will debut. So keep in mind, Screwattack and I are not selling out. Nothing has changed. We will still be making the same kind of videos we’ve always made with our own creative control. The quality is much better on GameTrailers than Youtube’s flash player, anyway. Go there and enjoy the new videos.</p>
