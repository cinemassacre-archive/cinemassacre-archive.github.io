I"ô<p>My classic about a thief on the run who is stalked by a mysterious gang of thugs who dress up like monsters. This is the movie that got my friends to act for me again, for the first time in two years and is the one and only accomplishment of mine which truly got me started on my new path of movie making! This movieâ€¦This day was the turning point of my life! This is the film that made me realize that I was destined to become a director and since then, I have been making movies non-stop.</p>
