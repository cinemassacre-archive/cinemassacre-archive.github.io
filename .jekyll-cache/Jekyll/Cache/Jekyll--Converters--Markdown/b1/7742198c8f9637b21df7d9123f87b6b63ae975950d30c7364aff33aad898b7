<p>I spent the last week in Las Vegas for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://www.weva.com/">WEVAâ€™s</a> videographer convention. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://dvideography.com/">DVideography</a> and I attended the seminars, and I did a commentary for a wedding video I edited. To some fansâ€™ surprise, I dropped no F-bombs. Also, we submitted some of our companyâ€™s videos to a contest and swept up some awards. We also went to a fake wedding for the purpose of demonstrating camera techniques. Later that night, I went into â€œAngry Nerd modeâ€, or â€œCrazy Cinemassacre modeâ€ and as a result, we made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://one.revver.com/watch/363924">this video:</a></p>
