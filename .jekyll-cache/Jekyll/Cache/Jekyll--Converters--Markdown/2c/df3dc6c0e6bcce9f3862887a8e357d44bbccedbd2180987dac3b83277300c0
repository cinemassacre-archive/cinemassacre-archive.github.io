I"Ò<p>This is a documentary about my next door neighbors who used to beat each other up after getting excited by watching wrestling on TV. For hours, I taped them lift each other in the air, fall down stairs, throw each other onto couches, and actually slam their heads against walls, leaving dents! Most of this is as real as it looks, but nobody was seriously injured. When I edited all the best moments to heavy metal music, it became a very entertaining video.</p>
