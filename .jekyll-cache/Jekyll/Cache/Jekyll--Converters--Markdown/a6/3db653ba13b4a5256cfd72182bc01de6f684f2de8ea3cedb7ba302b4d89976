I"Š<p>A fake documentary of myself as a tourist in Transylvania, exploring the woods, and stumbling upon the ruins of Draculaâ€™s castle. It actually took place in the woods behind my house in New Jersey, U.S.A. where there was an old stone building that was crumbling away, with vines and trees growing all around it. Itâ€™s sort of a Blair-Witch kind of movie, but this was years before it.</p>
