<p>In this part one of two episodes, The Nerd focuses his attention on Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 38.</p>

<p>“Gaming was dead, to begin with.”</p>

<p>For sheer grumpiness and unalloyed hatred, the Nerd has nothing on Ebenezer Scrooge, because instead of underpaid employees who deserve better, he has REAL reasons to get mad.</p>

<p>Instead of Tiny Tim, the Nerd has Kevin from the “Home Alone 2” game for NES to rail against. From the game’s confusing objectives to inconsistent gameplay, this notorious flop puts the “Yule” in “Yule never want to play it again.”</p>

<p>See the sins of gaming past laid bare in Part One of the Nerd’s very first Christmas special.</p>
