I"<p>This is the first time I was serious about making a movie. I wrote a script, gathered props and casted all of my friends from the neighborhood to make this moralistic horror/sci-fi b-movie about a scientist that brings back the dinosaurs from another dimension where they supposedly departed to. My friends were not serious about acting and all they did was play around. Soon, nobody was interested in making this movie at all and it was left unfinished. I thought Iâ€™d quit making movies with live actors forever.</p>
