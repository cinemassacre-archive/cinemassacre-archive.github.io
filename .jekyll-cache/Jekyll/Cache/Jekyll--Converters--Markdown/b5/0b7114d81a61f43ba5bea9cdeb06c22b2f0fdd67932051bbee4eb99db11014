I"F<p>I get possessed by the spirit of Snix and my only hope of driving the demon out is my neighbor to come over and whack me over the head with a golf club. Once defeated, the spirit appears inside the television set where he must confront his rival Xins before departing this dimension. Thereâ€™s some interesting editing and use of flashbacks. Each Snix movie is better than the one before it. As I age from 12 to 17 throughout the series, I grow both physically and mentally as an amatuer filmmaker who keeps improving. Also this is my first movie done on my new editing vcr.</p>
