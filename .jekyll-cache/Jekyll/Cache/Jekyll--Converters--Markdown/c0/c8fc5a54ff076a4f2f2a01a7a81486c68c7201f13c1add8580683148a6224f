I"P<p>One day, I was bored out of my mind, so I decided to make this surreal music video using hand puppets subjected to blacklights, animated cut out characters and plastic glow-in-the-dark skeletons moving by strings. My intention was to drown the viewer with bizarre imagery and make them feel like theyâ€™ve entered a dream world.</p>
