I"<p>A friend of mine, Phil, was over my house, so I decided to have him act in a quick improvised movie. The plot involved a demonic mask that is found harboring the soul of an ancient warlock who died in the year 1693. Now, three centuries later, he possesses Philâ€™s body once he wears the mask. Phil had to go home, so I cloned him with a hand-puppet and finished the movie all by myself. See also: 29. SNIX: THE RETURN, 37. SNIX AGAIN, 52. ROTTEN CORPSE OF SNIX, 53.
