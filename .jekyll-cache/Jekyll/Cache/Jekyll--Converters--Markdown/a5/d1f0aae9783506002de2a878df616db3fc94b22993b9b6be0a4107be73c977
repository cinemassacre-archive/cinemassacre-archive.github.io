<p>At the moment I type this, <strong>Led Zeppelin</strong> is performing their first full concert since 27 years ago! This is the most historical music event of my lifetime, but itâ€™s a shame that thereâ€™s no TV/radio or pay-per-view to air it. After all, it is a benefit concert and would probably raise more money if they put it on pay-per-view. Hopefully a DVD or better yet, a tour will come out of it. But we can only hope. Otherwise, thatâ€™s why bootlegs get made and itâ€™s unfortunate.</p>
