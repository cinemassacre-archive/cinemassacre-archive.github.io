I"Q<p>An improvised spoof of “Jaws” shot in my swimming pool without any continuity. It was cut like a trailer. The main joke was that it was a bad cheesy version of what used to be one of the highest grossing films of all time. The shark’s fin was made of cardboard, though there are still some good qualities. By placing the camera in a fish tank and carefully submerging it just below the water line, without getting any water in the top of the tank, I was able to get some beautiful underwater shots. An idea by Kirk and I, the two insane brains that brought you the Head Incident.</p>
