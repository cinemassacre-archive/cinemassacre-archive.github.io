<p>MTV flew me and Kyle Justin out to Los Angeles, California to shoot a promo for Gametrailers, Screwattack and myself. It was a surreal event, coming all the way across the country to be recognized on the streets and then later, being a part of the first live screwattack event. Pictures and video will follow later, but for the meantime, listen to it on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://screwattack.com/media/2007/SideScrollers_02_28_07.mp3">SIDESCROLLERS</a>.</p>

<p>I will also post more details about the MTV/GameTrailers promo when available. Overall, it was a great time out here in California, signing autographs to fans, meeting Game Jew and the boys at Screwattack.</p>

<p>Also, the new video is up, and it’s a long one!</p>
