I"∆<p>From 2013, this is an extra from the Board James DVD, which we will hopefully have back in stock again in the coming year. In the video, you can hear us talking about the early plans for the new episodes. At the time this was recorded, DreamPhone was the most recent episode. After the completion of the AVGN Movie Blu-ray features (2014), the new Board James episodes finally began production in early 2015. The season finale is ‚ÄúNIGHTMARE‚Äù.</p>
