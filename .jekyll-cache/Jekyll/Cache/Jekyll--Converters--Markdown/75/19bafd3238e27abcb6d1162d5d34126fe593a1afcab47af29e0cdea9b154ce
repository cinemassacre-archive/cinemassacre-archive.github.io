<p>– In episode 9 the Nerd reviews a strangle blue unlicensed game called “Master Chu and the Drunkard Hu” (NES)</p>

<p>– James felt this review was lacking, and needed an extra humor element. So he brought in a character called “Shit Pickle” to help him review the game. The character Shit Pickle first appeared in an animated parody of the Wizard of Oz we did entitled The Wizard of Oz 3: Dorthy Goes To Hell</p>

<p>– James does Shit Pickles voice. I drew the character.</p>

<p>The Nerd takes a look at the poor quality behind the game Master Chu and the Drunkard Hu for the NES. The first appearance of S**t Pickle! This is Angry Video Game Nerd episode 9.</p>

<p>Master Chu and the Drunkard Hu is an unlicensed NES game published by Color Dreams in 1989. The player plays as Master Chu, who goes on a mission to stop the evil Shiva who has cursed his village. His friend Hu couldn’t stop Shiva himself and has resorted to drinking.</p>

<p>The goal of the game is to collect Ying and Yang symbols in order to fight the boss at the end of each stage. You shoot energy at enemies, which include spiders, snakes and bats. The same formula is used in every stage of the game. This matched with stereotypical 8-bit Chinese music, sticky controls and boring boss fights makes you wonder if the game designers were drunk themselves.</p>

<p>In the Angry Video Game Nerd’s ninth episode he plays through the game and brings out a special guest reviewer, S**t Pickle.</p>
