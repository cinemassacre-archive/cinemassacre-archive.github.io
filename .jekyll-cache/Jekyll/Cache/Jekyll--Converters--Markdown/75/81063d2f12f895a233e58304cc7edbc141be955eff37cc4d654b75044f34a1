I"Ù<p>This is a horror movie I made in May 1996. It originally ran 30 minutes long, but this is a shortened version I made in 2006 to better suit the internet and the majority of attention spans. I was not feeling confident in the original film, but looking back, I no longer like this edit. It was not true to the original story, and discarded the twist ending. It also combines footage from the sequel â€œAn Evening of Real Supernatural Horrorâ€ and â€œMalevolenceâ€.</p>
