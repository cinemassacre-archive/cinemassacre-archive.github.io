<p>â€“ For episode 14 the Nerd reviews The Power Glove!</p>

<p>â€“ I believe the Power Glove, the sensors for the TV and most of the stack of games were mine. I remember telling James about how the sensors worked. (Not well! Thats how they worked!)</p>

<p>â€“ Around this time I gave James a large amount of my gaming stuff to use in the videos. Such as the Atari 5200 which appears a few episodes later. This was before fans began donating games. (Thanks by the way!)</p>
