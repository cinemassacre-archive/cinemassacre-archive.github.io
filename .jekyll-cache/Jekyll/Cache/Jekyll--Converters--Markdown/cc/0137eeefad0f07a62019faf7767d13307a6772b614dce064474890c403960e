I"±<p>The Nerd tries out his best moves, as he sees if The Karate Kid for the NES is as any good as the movie it is based on. This is Angry Video Game Nerd episode 3.</p>

<p>Released in Nov. 1987, this was the first game AVGN reviewed that gave him the reason to shun games released under the LJN banner. Based on the movie, The Karate Kid (1984) and The Karate Kid, part 2, you star as Daniel LaRusso, who has to use his karate skills to fight through levels and bosses.</p>

<p>Because of frustrating controls, hit detection, and pits that are hard to avoid, it would take timing and patience for a karate student like you to beat this game.</p>

<p>But for AVGNâ€¦see for yourselfâ€¦</p>
