I"i<p>Because of work and school consuming all my free time and college coming the next year, I knew I had to call it quits for my annual haunted house tour. I kept it a Halloween tradition from 1993 to 1998, but now I was becoming an adult and I was too busy to put all my time into it. This is why I made a video tour of the last one to preserve the memory.</p>
