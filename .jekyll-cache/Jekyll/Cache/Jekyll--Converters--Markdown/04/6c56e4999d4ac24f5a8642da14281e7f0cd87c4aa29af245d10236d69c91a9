I"‚<p>At the end of the last semester of Freshmen year, my friend Gina and I decided to make a sequel to our improvised Zone Out which was made at the beginning of the first semester. Again, thereâ€™s no logic or plot to this surreal work of art, but it subconsciously shows what we went through during the year and how weâ€™ve changed since the first Zone Out. See also 65. ZONE OUT.</p>
