<p>A psychological journey through the tormented mind of an art student. I made this during my Freshman year of college. It wasnâ€™t school-related, so it was nearly impossible to get it done on top of my regular assignments. Sometimes while filming, we were literally walking to class and making the movie at the same time. The end result may be rushed and sloppy, but itâ€™s interesting to see the ideas you can come up with when you just let loose. This movieâ€™s open for interpretation.</p>
