I"S<p>This is a psychological journey through the tormented mind of an art student who is summoned to the top of a gothic temple known as the Dreaded Drake Tower. An evil wizard who lives inside the top dome casts a spell on him, which gives him the power to involuntarily manifest horrible things. Whatever he imagines becomes a reality and his own creativeness becomes a doomsday dream which terminates the entire human race. The Drake Tower in Philadelphia is a sinister looking building that looks like the temple of Zuul in Ghostbusters. With special permission, I got to shoot on the top of it. This is a remake of my old film “Deadly Dreams” from 1993, but this one is much better. It’s highly experimental, with lots of metaphoric imagery, and shot loosely around school. It shows my filmmaking abililtes maturing past horror b-movies.</p>
