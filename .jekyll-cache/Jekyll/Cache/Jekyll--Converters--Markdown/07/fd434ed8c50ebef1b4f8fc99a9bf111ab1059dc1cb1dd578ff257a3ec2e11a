I"i<p>In my dorm around midnight some friends were hanging out. One of them wanted to make an experimental movie, so we decided that he’d shoot it and I’d edit it. He went out to the streets with his camera and came back at 3AM with some crazy footage of people hanging off street lamps and jumping into piles of garbage cans. I edited it and added music.</p>
