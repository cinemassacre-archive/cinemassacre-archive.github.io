I" <p>The killer character from “Mighty Joe Rampage” was so funny that we had to make another sequel. It begins with him escaping from a mental institution screaming his head off. Then, he goes back home, drinks his potion and goes even crazier. Just like the first movie, a second part was added. This is when another killer is introduced who wants to steal his beloved potion. The movie stopped here, because everybody was complaining about how cold the weather was. My favorite part was when Joe climbs up a chimney and then falls off!</p>
