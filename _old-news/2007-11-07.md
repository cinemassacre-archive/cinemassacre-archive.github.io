I am getting married this weekend and will be on vacation for most of the month. After Thanksgiving, I'll be catching up, which means there won't be any updates on the site for a while. I may not even be checking emails. If you're waiting for a response, it could take at least a month.

Oh yes, and the new Nerd video will go up by the end of November.
