## Texas trip

The Iron Man of Gaming event went well. I signed a ton of autographs, took pictures with fans, did a Q&A, and auctioned some of my AVGN props for charity, for the [Get Well Gamers Foundation.](https://web.archive.org/web/20091114225953/http://www.getwellgamers.org/) The props were: a Nerd shirt, one of several worn in the videos, the bald skin cap worn as Uncle Fester in my Fester's Quest video, and the beard worn as the old Nerd of the future in the Christmas Carol video. I would've brought more, but couldn't fit much in my luggage.

If you want me to autograph something, you can bring it. You can get pictures with me. Whatever, we're just hanging out. I'll be playing some good ol' gaming action with PBC Productions at 6pm. You can arrive whenever you'd like, I THINK I'll be there between 2pm and 8pm.

## AVGN action figures, a proposition

It's also been brought to my attention, a hilarious article on [Figures.com, proposing the idea of AVGN action figures.](https://web.archive.org/web/20091114225953/http://www.figures.com/databases/action.cgi?setup_file=fignews2.setup&category=actionfigures&topic=110&show_article=24&nl=1) Great ideas, I'm all for it!

## Nintendo's front page?
I've also appeared on the front page of [Nintendo.com! (Norwegian)](https://web.archive.org/web/20091114225953/http://nintendo.no/) It's a survey. English translation: "Have you ever played any of the games the avgn has reviewed?''
