Back from my trip! Had a good time but a hectic crazy time at E3. Attended the press conferences, met a lot of fans, game designers and website staff. Went to a lot of the after parties, had a lot of free booze, sat 4 seats away from Stan Lee, held a monkey, and played a lot of upcoming games such as Contra 4, Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, Super Mario Galaxy, Castlevania: Dracula X Chronicles, Resident Evil with the Wii Zapper, and the Wii fit games.

If you have 54 minutes to spare, you can see the talk show we did for [Coin-Op TV](https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://www.thestream.tv/watch.php?v=208). It was LIVE. After a tiring week at E3, I was nearly falling asleep during the show. If you skip to about 31:30, I recite the famous TMNT rant! In a Batman outfit!!!

You can also see our videos from E3, on [ScrewAttack.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://screwattack.com/), there's 4 videos on the main page.

The Angry Nerd's [gallery](https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/Nes_Nerd/gallery.html) page has been updated tremendously! Check it out. The fan art is out of control.

Also look out for my Simpsons game review, this week.

and yes, I held a monkey.
