Happy New Year!

I've been [interviewed on Micro-Shock.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20080324125629/http://www.dorkswithoutfaces.com/microshock/interviews/rolfe.html). It's a good one.

They also reviewed my zombie film [The Deader the Better.](https://web.archive.org/web/20080106112214/http://www.dorkswithoutfaces.com/microshock/Reviews/deaderbetter.html)

I'll also be appearing at MagFest on Friday. I'll probably conduct a Q&A or screen some Nerd videos and maybe show some new outtakes. There's no definite, announced time. I would say, get there early. [More info at Magfest.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20080226013131/http://magfest.org/)
