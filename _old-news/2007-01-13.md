Hey nerd fans,

We recorded a new 2 minute 50 second theme song for the [Angry Video Game Nerd](https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/Nes_Nerd.html) which will be on the DVD intro. If you don't wanna wait for the DVD, you can [hear it now](https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://void.snocap.com/s/T3-31324-QGXCN3277M-R/) for $0.99 (US). Think of it as a donation to help us move things forward. We thank you for your support.

-Kyle & James

One last look at the Nerd's old room.

No more video game rage there, but don't worry, it's for a good cause. I moved and l'm leaving my job to pursue freelance work with more flexible hours so I can cater more to my success as the Angry Video Game Nerd. If you enjoy watching my videos, I can honestly say I enjoy making them as well, but it's been very difficult to keep up with them on the side of a full time job. To be able to continue, I need some support. I'm releasing the [new 2 minute 50 second theme song as a 99 cent download](https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://void.snocap.com/s/T3-31324-QGXCN3277M-R/). T-shirts are coming soon. And after that, a DVD set compilation of all the nerd videos will be done.
