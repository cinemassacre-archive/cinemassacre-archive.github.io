## 2) Freddy's popped up in an odd place.

I've SORT OF been featured on Rolling Stone's website. They have an article where they mention Nightmare on Elm Street (the movie series). Even though it doesn't seem to be AVGN related, [notice the picture at the top. Look familiar?](https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://www.rollingstone.com/blogs/traverstake/2008/03/killer-boxoffice.php)

## 3) [New interview for the fans from Sweden.](https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://user.disk-one.se/BillyBigBurger/BBB/BillyBigBurger/avgn.html)

And if you're not from Sweden, it's still worth checking it out.

## 4) [A nice review of my work as the AVGN.](https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://www.anthonysfilmreview.com/Other/The_Angry_Video_Game_Nerd.htm)

5) What happened to the Nerd Comics?

At the time, we're not keeping up with them. That doesn't mean there will never be any more, but for now check out [Mike Matei's Deviant Art page](https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://mikematei.deviantart.com/) instead.

## 6) Heads up on the new Nerd video!

Some fans have suggested I do something big for my "50th video". I even got this piece of art from Iain.

But is it really my 50th? It depends if you count the Top 10 Nerd Moments, 2-part videos, and stuff like that. I personally don't consider it 50 yet. But either way, I can answer one thing. It's going to be a huge review. My wishes are to get back to doing shorter videos and go for the famous "quality over quantity", but I can't help it when I have so much to say. So expect it to be long, expect it to take another week or so to get done. And hopefully, after that, expect my reviews to be SHORTER from time to time.

So that's the "Nerd News" for the day. That's the way the cookie crumbles. That's the way the diarrhea hits the fan!
