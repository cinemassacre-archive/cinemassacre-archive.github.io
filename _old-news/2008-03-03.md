So I was making plans for the [Monster Mania convention](https://web.archive.org/web/20080319075612/http://monstermania.net/) when it came to my attention that Ben Chapman passed away on February 21st, 2008.

He played the Creature from the Black Lagoon (land scenes) which makes him one of the last of the Universal Monsters. (Ricou Browning played the creature underwater.)

He's been making live appearances and greeting fans ever since. He will be missed.

So here's a tribute I edited in 1995, using two VCR's. It's crap and I never intended on showing it to anyone, but now it seems appropriate.

Also, check out my review of Creature from the Black Lagoon from last October's Monster Madness Marathon.
