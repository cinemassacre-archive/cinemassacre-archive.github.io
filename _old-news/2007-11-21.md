First of all, to quote a line from Rocky II, "I jus' got a little married, y'know."

Then got back from a vacation and look at all the stuff that's happened while I've been away.

\* First of all, the [new video is up!](https://web.archive.org/web/20071126143128/http://www.gametrailers.com/player/28184.html)

[See it in Quicktime.](https://web.archive.org/web/20071126143128/http://www.gametrailers.com/player/28184.html?type=mov)

[See it in Windows.](https://web.archive.org/web/20071126143128/http://www.gametrailers.com/player/28184.html?type=wmv)

\* Second, we've been on Spike TV!

\* Then... I don't want to jinx it, but it looks like I finally have a [Wikipedia page](https://web.archive.org/web/20071126143128/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_angry_video_game_nerd). Let's see how long it takes before it gets deleted.

\* Then, I noticed another nice [article about me](https://web.archive.org/web/20071126143128/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/ceb/2007/11/12/life/do.you.play..html).

\* Also, a recent [interview from VGXPO 2007](https://web.archive.org/web/20071126143128/http://revver.com/watch/475866/flv/vgxpo-2007/) has surfaced, done by [PBC Productions.](https://web.archive.org/web/20071126143128/http://pbc-productions.com/)

\* And last, but certainly not least, the biggest news we've all been waiting for:

[THE DVD SET IS OUT! Buy it on ScrewAttack.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20071126143128/http://www.ewebcart.com/~12207/cgi-bin/cart.cgi/42210936/GFzNsGbE7FNu2US.dCAYECPmdRGyCBrCtEhwyvw3syU/?p=cart&la=a&ac=view)

![AVGN DVD cover back](https://i.imgur.com/KV46rzV.jpg)

The price is $18.98. Within the U.S., there's a flat shipping rate of $7.00. Outside the U.S, the shipping rate can vary. Keep in mind, the DVDs are packed with 4 hours of content.

THE BAD NEWS - The movie clips used in the Back to the Future and Rocky reviews have been removed, as well as any other videos that had copyrighted content, including music. I know that may be disappointing, but it would be our ass getting sued. Not yours. The internet is one thing, but when you're selling it, it can be a different story. Just wanted to end that debate before it starts.

THE GOOD NEWS - To make up for anything that I removed from the videos, I put new stuff in! The Wally bear and Rocky videos have new endings! The Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street videos have a new original soundtrack by Justin Sobers (Zalai.com) and it sounds much better!

NO NEW VIDEOS? - Many people are wondering why none of the videos from 2007 are included. Well, that's already about 4 hours worth of content right there. Yes, we are planning to release the new videos on DVD eventually. But FIRST, let's get the old ones out.

Anyway, that's the news, if you're someone who helped with the DVD and I already promised you a copy, it will be on the way as soon as I get them. For those who apply, Happy Thanksgiving, and see ya later.
