It's the 50th anniversary of the release of the cult classic The Blob which was filmed in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. One of the movie's key scenes takes place at the Colonial Theatre. Every year, the theatre celebrates "BlobFest". I will be showing up TONIGHT AND TOMORROW. If you're around the area, and happen to be a fan of The Blob, stop by. I might be conducting interviews. So if you wanna be in a CineMassacre Production, come on over!
