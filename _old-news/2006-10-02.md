"The horror fest is a four day event designed for those true fans of horror out there. The festival will be kicked off on October 27th at around noon at Lenny's Bar with a Zombie Walk, where hundreds of undead creatures will march from the historic Oakland Cemetery to downtown Atlanta and back. After the zombie walk, we begin the festivities with three nights of underground horror movie madness and a "Carrie" themed 70's prom at Eyedrum Theater. Right around the corner at Lenny's Bar on friday, saturday, and monday nights will be three nights of horror influenced Rock N Roll, costume contests, prizes, and more!!!"
