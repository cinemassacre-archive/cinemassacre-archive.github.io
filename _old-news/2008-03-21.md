## 1) [New AVGN article by Chris Lowrance.](https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://www.yesweekly.com/main.asp?SectionID=2&SubSectionID=96&ArticleID=3429)

## 2) [New Hardcore/Punk cover of AVGN theme song](https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://cinemassacre.com/AVGN/audio/songs/AVGN-Hardcore_Punk.mp3) by Slaymaker. [www.myspace.com/slaymakernoise](https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://myspace.com/slaymakernoise)

## 3) I FINALLY updated the [AVGN Fan Art gallery!](https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/Nes_Nerd/gallery/) About 80 more pictures are on there, totalling out to about 330. Friends and family find it weird that so many people are drawing me, but I'm used to it.

Also, I can't figure out why so many of the pictures aren't showing up. Probably because it's getting out of control. So I made a separate page showcasing [selected artwork.](https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://cinemassacre.com/AVGN/gallery/Selected_Gallery/)

If you're sending fan art, I have to ask a few things.

\* Please stop naming the files "AVGN" or "NERD". Every time I have more than one file with the same name, I have to change one of them. Just trust me, it's a hassle, so please try to use unique file names.

\* If possible, make it a jpeg. Otherwise, I have to change it.

\* Enough Mii's, Simpsons or South Park characters of me. And putting my face on a game box is being done to death too. Don't get the wrong idea. I love that you're doing fan art and the videos have made such an impression on you. But too much of the same thing is unnecessary.

## 4) New Nerd video Wednesday, March 26th. It's going to be the first of two parts.
