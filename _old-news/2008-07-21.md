BOTTOM LINE:

I thought Dark Knight was great! (4 stars)

I thought Batman Begins was good (3 stars)

However, I have several nitpicks about Batman Begins which are all addressed in the video. So if you hate me over it, please don't miss these comments.

BATMAN BEGINS

\- 8:00 "I know I'm completely a minority on this"

\-7:50 "Should I voice my honest opnion? Whether you agree or not..."

\-4:07 "Now after all my complaining, you probably think I hate this movie, but no, I didn't. In fact, I was able to sit through it 3 times, which says a lot for me. What I'm doing is what you call nitpicking."

\-3:35 "So relax. It's my own opinion and at least I gave my reasons. I didn't mean to bash it, but it already gets enough praise as it is."

I gave it 3 tumblers (stars) which means Good.
THE DARK KNIGHT

\-2:48 "It was pretty good."

\-0:47 "heath Ledger did a great job."

\-0:14 "Overall, pretty good."

I gave it 4 pencils in the eye (stars) which means Very good.

So what this proves is that the internet is a pathetic dictatorship. I think the Christopher Nolan Batman movies are very well made, but if you give them anything less than 5 stars, 10 out of 10, A + perfect rating, you get roasted.

"OPINIONS" are neither right nor wrong. Go look it up in the dictionary.
