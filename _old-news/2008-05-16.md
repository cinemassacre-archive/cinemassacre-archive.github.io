## NEW SITE UPDATES

The new improved CineMassacre.com will launch in JUNE. The site should be a little more organized by then.

## NEXT AVGN VIDEO: May 21st

Lots of people seem to be confused by the ending of ["NES Accessories"](https://web.archive.org/web/20091114232448/http://www.gametrailers.com/player/34014.html). It hints at R.O.B. the one important accessory I left out. But no, I am NOT planning a review of R.O.B. anytime soon. When I do, it'll be epic and will take a lot of time to make. For now, I'm trying to give myself a break and focus on reviewing basic games, instead of console reviews, game peripherals or giant compilations. Mark my words at the end of the video "save it til later."

If the hat and the music didn't clue some of you in, maybe this picture will make it more clear.

With the fourth Indiana Jones movie hitting theatres soon, we're gonna take a look at the "trilogy".
