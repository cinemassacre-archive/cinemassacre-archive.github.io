At the moment I type this, **Led Zeppelin** is performing their first full concert since 27 years ago! This is the most historical music event of my lifetime, but it's a shame that there's no TV/radio or pay-per-view to air it. After all, it is a benefit concert and would probably raise more money if they put it on pay-per-view. Hopefully a DVD or better yet, a tour will come out of it. But we can only hope. Otherwise, that's why bootlegs get made and it's unfortunate.
