[Munky Cheez channel added to YouTube](https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=MunkyCheez). Warning: if you show it to your kids, they'll go crazy and say "Munky Cheez!" non-stop. That's proven.

I tried to make them more child friendly on the YouTube account. For the UNCENSORED versions, find them on the [movies page](https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/animation.html).
