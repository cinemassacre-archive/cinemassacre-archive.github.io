No, it's not real. It's fan-made. Like I said in my Rocky Balboa review, the music of Survivor and the Rocky films go together like bread and butter.

Since 2006 marked the return of Rocky and Survivor, it would have been fitting if they included a new Survivor song in the new Rocky movie. That didn't happen, so here's my idea of what it would have been like, and hey, it's not too late for Rocky 7. Just kidding.

My favorite song off the album is "Fire Makes Steel", but I chose the title track "Reach" because it fit the montage the best.
