If you've been enjoying my movie reviews on YouTube, then stay tuned for more on Spike.com. There will be at least 1 movie review a month, usually about 4 minutes in length. Sometimes they'll be a little longer. Coming first is a 3 part retrospective of all the live action Batman movies, yes including The Dark Knight (which will be up after the movie comes out). The first part goes up July 7th. Be sure to stop by and check it out!

Also a special credit must go out to Mike Matei for editing all this stuff!
