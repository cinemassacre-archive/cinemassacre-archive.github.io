One weekend, in May of 1996, I was bored, and inspired by classic silent horror films such as Nosferatu, I decided to make my own movie in my backyard. After that, it became a habit. This weekend, a decade ago, was THE TURNING POINT OF MY LIFE, because I discovered something that I enjoy doing and I wanted to continue making movies for the rest of my life. Today, that desire has not changed at all. I can't believe that now 10 years have passed and I have come such a long way. Depasquales, thanks for being a part of it and, seriously, can you BELIEVE it was 10 YEARS ago?!
