## ["Welcome to Warp Zone"](https://web.archive.org/web/20081208213642/http://www.thesimon.com/magazine/articles/diamond_in_the_rough/01591_welcome_warp_zone.html)

A flattering, but well written article by Matt Sigl has caught my attention. [Check it out.](https://web.archive.org/web/20081208213642/http://www.thesimon.com/magazine/articles/diamond_in_the_rough/01591_welcome_warp_zone.html) It's a good read, but not just because I'm in it.
