## New AVGN video!

## STAR TREK

A little later than expected, but it's still Wednesday and technically not late. It's funny to note that this is a video that's been delayed longer than any AVGN video to date. The gameplay portion of the NES game was recorded back in the summer of 2006. You can even see a clip in the intro to the Master Chu and the Drunkard Hu video.

For some reason, there's no Quicktime or Windows link yet, so [watch it in Flash for now.](https://web.archive.org/web/20091114225953/http://www.gametrailers.com/player/35049.html?type=flv)
