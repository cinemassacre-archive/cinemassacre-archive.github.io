This is a rare clip from my college days (dated 2003) giving an introduction to a musical performance by [Bootsy Spankins P.I.](https://web.archive.org/web/20091114225953/http://www.myspace.com/bootsyspankinspi) What's real funny is that Bootsy himself posted this clip, but didn't include the performance, though it's the most epic prolonged introduction ever since the unveiling of Super Mario Bros 3 in the movie The Wizard. And there was also a lot of beer being consumed.
