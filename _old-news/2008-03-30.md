I spent about 9 hours yesterday fixing my site. What a pain in the ass.

First of all, there were many pictures not showing up in my [Fan Art Gallery](https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/Nes_Nerd/gallery/), So I ended up having to look through over 300 files and deleting any of them which had spaces. Spaces seem to cause a bizarre "%20" thing that just fucks everything up. Isn't web design great? Picky motherfuckin' bastard! So anyway, it should all work now. If you're gonna send fan art, please:

1\) don't use spaces.

2\) always use jpegs.

3\) try to use unique file names. No "Nerd" or "AVGN".

Doesn't it suck to have so many rules? Fuck the web. Fuck it to hell!

Also I fixed up my [VIDEOS PAGE](https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://cinemassacre.com/AVGN/Nes_Nerd_videos.html), which took the majority of the 9 hours. I think it looks a lot better now, but I know there's probably going to be a bunch of bad links. There always is. So let me know if you find anything wrong. (TheCinemassacre@yahoo.com)

"Top 10 Jackie Chan Stunts" got over a million views, in less than 2 weeks. Damn! That's gotta be a record for me, even for AVGN standards!

Next will be Top 10 Jackie Chan Fight Scenes. I'll probably post it sometime in May, because April is going to be Rocky month! Speaking of Rocky month, I will be posting the 6 Rocky reviews on my ["Cinemassacre" YouTube channel.](https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://www.youtube.com/user/cinemassacre) My documentary Rocky Jumped a Park Bench will be on the ["JamesNintendoNerd" channel](https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://www.youtube.com/user/JamesNintendoNerd) sometime near the end of April, and most likely, in 2 parts. Sorry for the confusion.

I might to get around to doing some email tonight, but afterwards, I'm concentrating on the next Nerd video. Then I'm eating whale turds and covering myself in dog shit.
