The Cinemassacre productions teamed up with Lucky Bastard productions for the Philadelphia [48 Hour Film Project](https://web.archive.org/web/20050905194136/http://www.48hourfilm.com/). We even took an award for "Best Cinematography." Good job, everyone. The film, written, directed, and edited in under two days, is titled "Death Seen", ironically after my last year's 48 hour film, "The Death Suit." The genre we drew was Mystery. What we turned out was a creepy tale of a mysterious figure in black following someone, sort of like "The Head Incident" (1999).
