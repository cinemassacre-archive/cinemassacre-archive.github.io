I made a live appearance at Digital Press game store in Clifton, NJ. The place was packed! Signed autographs, played a game tournament, picked up some games... everything went over very well. [See more pictures.](https://web.archive.org/web/20091114225953/http://www.digitpress.com/images/store/)

Also, an epic battle took place in the parking lot with a live audience:
