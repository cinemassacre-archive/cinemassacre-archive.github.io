I'm back. I've just really been burning myself out with all these videos, so I took a much needed rest. While I was away, the new Nerd video was released already. I had no idea it would be so soon.

As you probably already know, the whole script for the video was based off of fan emails. It was a fun little experiment and I hope you enjoy it. It was fun for me, and challenging to arrange quotes and to keep a flow and construct the video without using any of my own words. (there are a few of my own words to join some of the topics, but 99% is all the fans.) I do have to say, I scanned through as many of the 6,000 + emails as I possibly could, picking out anything I thought stood out. I've read a lot of really bizarre stuff. The next video is also a little different, but instantly one of my favorites. I look forward to you seeing it.

Stay tuned for many many more pictures/videos/links coming up soon. I'm gonna be on a steady roll. Thanks, Matt for the update while I was away.
