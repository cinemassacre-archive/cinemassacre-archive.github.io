As you probably know, I get an overwhelming amount of [AVGN fan art](https://web.archive.org/web/20091114225953/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/Nes_Nerd/gallery/) sent to me on a daily basis. I try to update it once a month, but still I can't keep up with it.

So here's the deal. ScrewAttack.com staff are taking care of it. If you want to send fan art, send to NerdFan@ScrewAttack.com where it can be viewed at
[http://screwattack.com/AVGN/FanArt](https://web.archive.org/web/20091114225953/http://screwattack.com/AVGN/FanArt).

But if you'd like ME to see it and possibly include it in the [selected gallery](https://web.archive.org/web/20091114225953/http://cinemassacre.com/AVGN/gallery/Selected_Gallery/), you may send me a copy at TheCinemassacre@yahoo.com. But due to high volume of email, just please don't expect a response. I appreciate all the fan effort, it's truly amazing, but sorry I can't answer all your emails.
