The savage werewolf attack in "Rumble in the Jungle."

Time to dust off 3 Cinemassacre classics from July 1997.

["Feeling of Terror"](https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://youtube.com/watch?v=akbceHt45Us), a horror movie montage that I put a lot of work into, editing on VHS with analog equipment.

["Rumble in the Jungle "](https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://youtube.com/watch?v=XhzH6k6B8og). This is just the trailer, edited with two VCR's. The full movie was a piece of crap.

["Bicycle Speed "](https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phDbMl1Q9EU). This is just ridiculous and is the first in a series starring goofy characters named Timmy and Jimmy. This is before South Park took my idea! Oh and guess what, there was NO EDITING, all the cuts were made in-camera, then the sound was dubbed in live. (that is while the VHS tape was being copied, we were redubbing our voices and the music was coming from a portable tape player.) Another piece of trivia: we made this movie the same day we did Rumble in the Jungle. Notice the same clothes.
