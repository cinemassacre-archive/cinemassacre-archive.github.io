## AVGN DVD LINK?

I'm getting a lot of questions about the AVGN DVD Vol 1. Why aren't the links working? Right now, ScrewAttack is updating their site which means there will probably be a new merchandise page. As soon as they have that ready, I'll fix my links.

I'm also aware that some of the video links aren't working. They'll be fixed too.
