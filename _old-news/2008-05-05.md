## New AVGN links:

Keeping up with this stuff is a full time chore, let alone MAKING THE VIDEOS! This website, in case you don't know, is run by me alone. And for the amount of traffic I've gotten, which just keeps on accelerating, it's an amazing accomplishment for a shitty website run by one person! But not for long, I'm getting help.

A few months ago, I met with a new web designer whom I'll introduce later. He'll be helping me take care of this stuff, so sometime this month, we will be launching a revised CineMassacre.com. Same place, new look. Coming soon.

Anyway, here's 3 updates.

1\) Theme song covers:

*'Hello, I am Gavin MacLean. I am currently in the early stages of developing a new AVGN computer game! I have here some artwork I made, two video download links, one leading to a video showing the intro to the game, the other leading to a sneak peek video featuring basic game play. (Note: videos are in avi format and the sneak peek is outdated, meaning many changes have already been made since it was made) Enjoy them, I will send new stuff to the nerd when I can and if you have any idea's for me, comments, or fan mail, send your e-mails to avgnLordGavin@yahoo.com. Enjoy!'*

Here are the two videos:
