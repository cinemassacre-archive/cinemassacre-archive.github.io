Hi fans,

I will be away for a couple weeks in July which means there probably won't be any updates to the site for a while and I won't be answering many emails til later, so if you tried to reach me, please be patient. But there will be two Angry Video Game Nerd releases as planned. One on the 4th of July, and one on the 18th of July, I believe. So check in here[http://gametrailers.com/screwattack.php](https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://gametrailers.com/screwattack.php)

Have a great holiday.

-James
