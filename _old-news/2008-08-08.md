## Updates from me:

The AVGN Batman conclusion should be up Monday.

The Deadly Towers video will be next, sometime before the end of August. It's the first "fan interactive" video where I'm building the script based off of emails. If you're one of the lucky ones, I hope you enjoy hearing me use your words. But for everyone else, I want to thank you for sending stuff. I wish I could read all of them, but there's 6,476 emails, last time I checked. So it would be impossible for me to get through them all. There's also no judgement factor in choosing the quotes. It just depended on what I felt worked best for the video.

I've also been very hard at work on the AVGN Volume 2 DVD. I'm glad to see it finally coming together. More details to come. But I'll say one thing.... triple disc!
