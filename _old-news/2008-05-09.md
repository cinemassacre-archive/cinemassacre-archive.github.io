## Rocky Jumped a Park Bench

## IN FULL QUALITY

My 27 minute Rocky documentary / tour of all the Philadelphia filming locations, is now available in full quality thanks to Pierre-Luc Delisle.

STEP 1: Download the torrent here. [http://thepiratebay.org/search/Rocky%20jumped%20a%20park%20bench%20/0/99/0](https://web.archive.org/web/20091114232448/http://thepiratebay.org/search/Rocky%20jumped%20a%20park%20bench%20/0/99/0)

STEP 2: Download a torrent program.
For example [http://azureus.sourceforge.net/](https://web.archive.org/web/20091114232448/http://azureus.sourceforge.net/): or [http://www.utorrent.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/20091114232448/http://www.utorrent.com/)

STEP 3: Drop the torrent into your program and begin downloading the whole 1 GB file. If you're familiar with how torrents work, at this point, it should be a piece of cake. Personally, I'm not too familiar, and its my first time using them. You can read more about torrents on [wikipedia.](https://web.archive.org/web/20091114232448/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_%28protocol%29)

STEP 4: Watch the movie. The torrent has only one file, the DVD image in .iso format. So either burn it to DVD using a DVD burning program like [Nero](https://web.archive.org/web/20091114232448/http://www.nero.com/enu/nero8-introduction.html) for example or if you want to watch on your computer WITHOUT burning a DVD, download [VLC player](https://web.archive.org/web/20091114232448/http://vlcplayer-download.info/?gclid=COPQ5MiRmpMCFQFlHgodAwrsZQ) and watch it on there.

STEP 5: Please "seed" the torrent. Sorry I can't offer much explanation to that. But if you know what I'm talking about, you'll know it helps share the file around and distrubute the data. Right now, Pierre-Luc is using all his own bandwith to keep the file active. Basically, just keep the downloaded torrent in your "downloaded files".

Thanks! And as always, you can still watch it on YouTube.
