The last time Friday the 13th occurred in October was in the year 2000. And I also released a video then as well. It was a music video for Black sabbath. It was edited with two vcr's. Yes, all the cutting was done without computers. Check it out.

[BLACK SABBATH (2000)](https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/086_Black_Sabbath.mpg) 6 min, 25 MB

All of the stock footage is mine, borrowed from my older films. This is one of the last editing jobs I've ever done using my primitive two-VCR method, without any computers, not even the title in the beginning. Some of the cutting near the end is so fast, that certain shots last only a fraction of a second which really is amazing, considering it was just two-VCRs.
