An animated spoof and semi-sequel to "Wizard of Oz" and "Return to Oz." It's a mix between South Park, Monty Python and Aqua Teen Hugner Force.

First there was:

"WIZARD OF OZ" (1939)

Dorothy gets stranded in the land of Oz, meets the Scarecrow, Tin Man, & Lion for the first time and kills the Wicked Witch of the East & West.

Then there was:

"RETURN TO OZ" (1985)

Dorothy escapes a psychiatric experiment, fleeing back to Oz and finds that Oz is all fucked up by the Nome King. Famous characters from the first movie are altered, Toto is replaced by a chicken, and everything is dark and twisted.

NOW:

Everything's going to get EVEN MORE FUCKED UP!

"WIZARD OF OZ 3" (2006)

Dorothy has to go back to Oz again to save her friends from Satan. Now Toto is replaced by Shit Pickle and we get to find out where that red brick road leads to.

*WATCH IT!*

## Just a bit of warning, it is very R-rated!

I started this film 4 years ago, so it's very exciting that it's finally done.
