The Cinemassacre teamed up with Chickenhug Films for the Philadelphia [48 Hour Film Project](https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://www.48hourfilm.com/). This was my 3rd time doing this. We worked very efficiently and even had about 10 hours to sleep. The film still looked good in the end.
