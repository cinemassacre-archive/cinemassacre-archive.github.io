I finished this film a year ago, but wasn't very experienced with uploading videos to the internet. Now that I'm more knowledged, I've re-uploaded the movie in BETTER quality and SMALLER file size! So now you can see it the way it should have been before.

I plan on maybe making a bigger budget feature length sequel/remake sometime hopefully in the future. For now, I'm enjoying much success as the [Angry Video Game Nerd](https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/Nes_Nerd.html) and hopefully can use it to branch into my filmmaking career. I think [The Deader the Better](https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/125_TDTB.mov) was one of my best works, so [check it out.](https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/125_TDTB.mov)
