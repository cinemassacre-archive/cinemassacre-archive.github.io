  <p class="gold">Old site description:</p>
  <p>Inspired by zombie horror classics such as “Night of the Living Dead” and “Dawn of the Dead”, I wrote a script, casted my friends and made my own classic. The simplistic plot revolves around a guy who witnesses an evil sorcerer resurrect some corpses from a graveyard. Struck with fear, he runs away from this terrifying scene, but the sorcerer sends the zombies after him. The chase lasts throughout the film as he finds different weapons. He shoves a pool stick through the body of one zombie and crushes another under a garage door. “Red Zombie” was meant to be a comedy, so I exaggerated the amount of blood tremendously. For example, there’s a scene where Mike lifts a zombie up to a ceiling fan. First, we see a shot of the zombie’s head going up near the fan. In the next shot, we see a close-up of Mike’s face grimacing as gallons of blood begin to pour all over him. We had a lot of fun making this movie, but the star lost interest halfway through production, so this movie was never finished. As a side note, it’s the first movie that I shot raw and edited on my two vcr’s. The title is a spoof of the 1932 Bela Lugosi cult classic “White Zombie.”</p>











<p class="gold">James's old ratings:</p>

<p>Back in 2003 James included star ratings with each film he listed on his filmography on his website (the text under the star rating was his description of what the star rating meant). Later on he switched to ratings out of ten.</p>

<p>Eventually, he dropped the ratings entirely.</p>
