  <p class="gold">Old site description:</p>
  <p>I had a computer program called “3D Movie Maker” where you can select characters, pick locations and program them to walk about and do as you command to tell a story. I ended up making an epic action horror film which is somewhat of a remake of Red Zombie. It shares the same title as the improv, but bears no resemblance to it.</p>




  <p class="gold">Description from Cinemassacre.com:</p>
  <p>This is a little animated movie I made in 1997, on a program called 3D Movie Maker. You can pick scenery, change camera angles, record audio, select characters, change their clothes, make them move. Most of the actions include dancing or jumping, but I did everything I could to make it look like they were fighting, so I really had to push the limits of the software to make the characters do what I wanted.</p>

<p>Also, I was running Windows 95 on an old PC with a 3 GB hardrive. With a movie over 20 minutes, I was lucky when it would load.</p>

<p>The only way I was able to record it, was on my old VHS camera pointed at the monitor.
3 things you’ll hear that don’t belong are
1) a telephone ringing.
2) my dog barking.
3) my sister yelling at me.</p>

<p>I wish the quality could be better, but I’m fortunate the tape still exists.</p>









<p class="gold">James's old ratings:</p>

<p>Back in 2003 James included star ratings with each film he listed on his filmography on his website.</p>

<p>Later on he switched to ratings out of ten.</p>

<p>Eventually, he dropped the ratings entirely.</p>
