<p>I spent about 9 hours yesterday fixing my site. What a pain in the ass.</p>

<p>First of all, there were many pictures not showing up in my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/Nes_Nerd/gallery/">Fan Art Gallery</a>, So I ended up having to look through over 300 files and deleting any of them which had spaces. Spaces seem to cause a bizarre “%20” thing that just fucks everything up. Isn’t web design great? Picky motherfuckin’ bastard! So anyway, it should all work now. If you’re gonna send fan art, please:</p>

<p>1) don’t use spaces.</p>

<p>2) always use jpegs.</p>

<p>3) try to use unique file names. No “Nerd” or “AVGN”.</p>

<p>Doesn’t it suck to have so many rules? Fuck the web. Fuck it to hell!</p>

<p>Also I fixed up my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://cinemassacre.com/AVGN/Nes_Nerd_videos.html">VIDEOS PAGE</a>, which took the majority of the 9 hours. I think it looks a lot better now, but I know there’s probably going to be a bunch of bad links. There always is. So let me know if you find anything wrong. (TheCinemassacre@yahoo.com)</p>

<p>“Top 10 Jackie Chan Stunts” got over a million views, in less than 2 weeks. Damn! That’s gotta be a record for me, even for AVGN standards!</p>

<p>[Broken YouTube embed:</p>

<p>Next will be Top 10 Jackie Chan Fight Scenes. I’ll probably post it sometime in May, because April is going to be Rocky month! Speaking of Rocky month, I will be posting the 6 Rocky reviews on my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://www.youtube.com/user/cinemassacre">“Cinemassacre” YouTube channel.</a> My documentary Rocky Jumped a Park Bench will be on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://www.youtube.com/user/JamesNintendoNerd">“JamesNintendoNerd” channel</a> sometime near the end of April, and most likely, in 2 parts. Sorry for the confusion.</p>

<p>I might to get around to doing some email tonight, but afterwards, I’m concentrating on the next Nerd video. Then I’m eating whale turds and covering myself in dog shit.</p>
