<p>Lots of people seem to be confused by the ending of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091114232448/http://www.gametrailers.com/player/34014.html">“NES Accessories”</a>. It hints at R.O.B. the one important accessory I left out. But no, I am NOT planning a review of R.O.B. anytime soon. When I do, it’ll be epic and will take a lot of time to make. For now, I’m trying to give myself a break and focus on reviewing basic games, instead of console reviews, game peripherals or giant compilations. Mark my words at the end of the video “save it til later.”</p>

<p>If the hat and the music didn’t clue some of you in, maybe this picture will make it more clear.</p>
