<p>First of all, to quote a line from Rocky II, “I jus’ got a little married, y’know.”</p>

<p>Then got back from a vacation and look at all the stuff that’s happened while I’ve been away.</p>

<p>* First of all, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071126143128/http://www.gametrailers.com/player/28184.html">new video is up!</a></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071126143128/http://www.gametrailers.com/player/28184.html?type=mov">See it in Quicktime.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071126143128/http://www.gametrailers.com/player/28184.html?type=wmv">See it in Windows.</a></p>

<p>* Second, we’ve been on Spike TV!</p>

<p>[Broken flash embed]</p>

<p>* Then… I don’t want to jinx it, but it looks like I finally have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071126143128/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_angry_video_game_nerd">Wikipedia page</a>. Let’s see how long it takes before it gets deleted.</p>

<p>* Then, I noticed another nice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071126143128/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/ceb/2007/11/12/life/do.you.play..html">article about me</a>.</p>

<p>* Also, a recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071126143128/http://revver.com/watch/475866/flv/vgxpo-2007/">interview from VGXPO 2007</a> has surfaced, done by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071126143128/http://pbc-productions.com/">PBC Productions.</a></p>

<p>* And last, but certainly not least, the biggest news we’ve all been waiting for:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071126143128/http://www.ewebcart.com/~12207/cgi-bin/cart.cgi/42210936/GFzNsGbE7FNu2US.dCAYECPmdRGyCBrCtEhwyvw3syU/?p=cart&amp;la=a&amp;ac=view">THE DVD SET IS OUT! Buy it on ScrewAttack.com</a></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KV46rzV.jpg" alt="AVGN DVD cover back" />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0iNPDCh.jpg" alt="AVGN DVD cover front" /></p>

<p>The price is $18.98. Within the U.S., there’s a flat shipping rate of $7.00. Outside the U.S, the shipping rate can vary. Keep in mind, the DVDs are packed with 4 hours of content.</p>

<p>THE BAD NEWS - The movie clips used in the Back to the Future and Rocky reviews have been removed, as well as any other videos that had copyrighted content, including music. I know that may be disappointing, but it would be our ass getting sued. Not yours. The internet is one thing, but when you’re selling it, it can be a different story. Just wanted to end that debate before it starts.</p>

<p>THE GOOD NEWS - To make up for anything that I removed from the videos, I put new stuff in! The Wally bear and Rocky videos have new endings! The Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street videos have a new original soundtrack by Justin Sobers (Zalai.com) and it sounds much better!</p>

<p>NO NEW VIDEOS? - Many people are wondering why none of the videos from 2007 are included. Well, that’s already about 4 hours worth of content right there. Yes, we are planning to release the new videos on DVD eventually. But FIRST, let’s get the old ones out.</p>

<p>Anyway, that’s the news, if you’re someone who helped with the DVD and I already promised you a copy, it will be on the way as soon as I get them. For those who apply, Happy Thanksgiving, and see ya later.</p>
