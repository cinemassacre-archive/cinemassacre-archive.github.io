<h2 id="star-trek">STAR TREK</h2>

<p>A little later than expected, but it’s still Wednesday and technically not late. It’s funny to note that this is a video that’s been delayed longer than any AVGN video to date. The gameplay portion of the NES game was recorded back in the summer of 2006. You can even see a clip in the intro to the Master Chu and the Drunkard Hu video.</p>

<p>For some reason, there’s no Quicktime or Windows link yet, so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091114225953/http://www.gametrailers.com/player/35049.html?type=flv">watch it in Flash for now.</a></p>
