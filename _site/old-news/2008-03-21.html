Friends and family find it weird that so many people are drawing me, but I’m used to it.</h2>

<p>Also, I can’t figure out why so many of the pictures aren’t showing up. Probably because it’s getting out of control. So I made a separate page showcasing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://cinemassacre.com/AVGN/gallery/Selected_Gallery/">selected artwork.</a></p>

<p>If you’re sending fan art, I have to ask a few things.</p>

<p>* Please stop naming the files “AVGN” or “NERD”. Every time I have more than one file with the same name, I have to change one of them. Just trust me, it’s a hassle, so please try to use unique file names.</p>

<p>* If possible, make it a jpeg. Otherwise, I have to change it.</p>

<p>* Enough Mii’s, Simpsons or South Park characters of me. And putting my face on a game box is being done to death too. Don’t get the wrong idea. I love that you’re doing fan art and the videos have made such an impression on you. But too much of the same thing is unnecessary.</p>
