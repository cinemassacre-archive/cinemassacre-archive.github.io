<p>BOTTOM LINE:</p>

<p>I thought Dark Knight was great! (4 stars)</p>

<p>I thought Batman Begins was good (3 stars)</p>

<p>However, I have several nitpicks about Batman Begins which are all addressed in the video. So if you hate me over it, please don’t miss these comments.</p>

<p>BATMAN BEGINS</p>

<p>- 8:00 “I know I’m completely a minority on this”</p>

<p>-7:50 “Should I voice my honest opnion? Whether you agree or not…”</p>

<p>-4:07 “Now after all my complaining, you probably think I hate this movie, but no, I didn’t. In fact, I was able to sit through it 3 times, which says a lot for me. What I’m doing is what you call nitpicking.”</p>

<p>-3:35 “So relax. It’s my own opinion and at least I gave my reasons. I didn’t mean to bash it, but it already gets enough praise as it is.”</p>

<p>I gave it 3 tumblers (stars) which means Good.
THE DARK KNIGHT</p>

<p>-2:48 “It was pretty good.”</p>

<p>-0:47 “heath Ledger did a great job.”</p>

<p>-0:14 “Overall, pretty good.”</p>

<p>I gave it 4 pencils in the eye (stars) which means Very good.</p>

<p>So what this proves is that the internet is a pathetic dictatorship. I think the Christopher Nolan Batman movies are very well made, but if you give them anything less than 5 stars, 10 out of 10, A + perfect rating, you get roasted.</p>

<p>“OPINIONS” are neither right nor wrong. Go look it up in the dictionary.</p>
