<p>I’ve been asked a lot if I’m doing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://48hourfilm.com/">48 hour film project</a> again this year. Unfortunately, I don’t think I have the time. Trying to keep up with the nerd videos and all these other side projects, I completely burned myself out. But I’ve uploaded all my previous 48 hour films on YouTube, so you can see them if you want.The Death Suit (2004)</p>

<p>What is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://48hourfilm.com/">48 Hour film Project?</a></p>

<p>Filmmaking teams have
just one weekend to make a short film.
All creativity—writing, shooting,
editing and adding a musical
soundtrack—must occur in a 48 hour
window beginning Friday evening at
7 and ending Sunday at 7. The
following week, the completed films
are screened to an eager audience.
Each team draws a genre out of a hat,
such as Sci-Fi, Horror, Western, Spy,
Road Movie, Super Hero, Mockumentary
and every team is given a prop, a line of
dialogue, and a character which all must
be included in the finished film.</p>
