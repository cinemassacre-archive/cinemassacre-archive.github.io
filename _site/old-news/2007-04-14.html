<p>The Deader the Better won an award at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://film.camden.rutgers.edu/festival/index.htm">New Century Film Festival</a>. To the fans and anyone who expected me, I’m sorry I couldn’t attend. I would have never missed a screening of one of my films, but I had more urgent issues I had to tend to.</p>
