<p>Happy Birthday, Bela Lugosi.</p>

<p>He came to the USA hoping to play romantic hero characters, but instead would be cast as foregin villains and of course being typecast as Dracula. Lugosi just went along with the whole thing, embraced his fans and took the Dracula cape to his grave, literally. It’s sort of like how I’ve accidentally stumbled upon fame as the Angry Video Game Nerd. Things happen by surprise and you take what you get. In a more generic sense, it’s like you just take what life gives you and enjoy. With that being said, CineMassacre salutes the one and only</p>
