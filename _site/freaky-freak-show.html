  <p class="gold">Old site description:</p>
  <p>“There’s this old man who’s dying and he wants one last entertainment before he goes. So he gathers together all his friends, all the freaks, to give him one last big show. It’s a Freaky Freak-Show!” This was the opening narration for this three-act music video. Each of the three songs served as the beginning, middle and end for the story. It was the easiest movie to act in. Just wear a weird mask, dress up weird and dance around my backyard. My only cast were all my neighborhood friends who were always busy, so unfortunately, It took me a couple months to finish this simple idea and I never got more than three “freaks” together at the same time. That includes myself. The whole movie shows mostly individual freaks by theirselves, so I had to cut everything together to try and create a feeling that the whole yard is full of 50 freaks. I didn’t capture the insane party atmosphere as I hoped, but it’s still an entertaining feast for the eyes.</p>











<p class="gold">James's old ratings:</p>

<p>Back in 2003 James included star ratings with each film he listed on his filmography on his website.</p>

<p>Later on he switched to ratings out of ten.</p>

<p>Eventually, he dropped the ratings entirely.</p>
