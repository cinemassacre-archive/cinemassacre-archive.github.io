<h3 class="center">This page is a total work in progress. It will look better later (and be split up so that it's not all loading at once).</h3>

<p>What's here now is basically just a first pass to collect what was available. Some images are noted as missing because they weren't included in the Wayback Machine's archive, but I've found many of them still live in different places on the current Cinemassacre site. The same with embeds - most of those videos are still available. I just need to go back through and insert them. It's all a whole process of finding and sorting and all that.</p>

<h2 id="my-first-update-since-may-2004">MY FIRST UPDATE SINCE MAY 2004</h2>

<p>Well let me sum things up. I’ve been busy as friggin’ hell.</p>

<h3 id="graduation-aftermath">GRADUATION AFTERMATH</h3>

<p>Last May, I finished my senior film “The Jersey Odysseys: Episode I: Legend of the Blue Hole” and graduated from the University of the Arts.</p>

<p>Following my graduation, I got a job at a liquor store, during the summer, where I basically rotted myself away. All I did was stock the same shelves, day after day, while everybody around me talked about cars, girls, and sports. It was so boring, because I was used to being around creative artistic people.</p>

<h3 id="jersey-odysseys-dvd-postponed">JERSEY ODYSSEYS DVD POSTPONED</h3>

<p>On my spare time, I worked on a Jersey Odysseys DVD, complete with a trailer, deleted scenes, director commentary and a bonus films. I finished the DVD and was planning to give copies out to everybody involved with the film, but I realized that I was having a lot of trouble copying them. First of all, it took too long and, second, they never played right. They always skipped and froze, so I apologize to everybody for saying that I was going to give you a DVD when I never did, but I’m STILL trying to get my tech problems worked out.</p>

<h3 id="new-dream-project">NEW DREAM PROJECT</h3>

<p>Also over the summer, I was working on a new horror movie script entitled “The Deader the Better.” While plans to make another Jersey Odysseys episode went on halt for the meantime, I was really excited about this new idea. The Deader the Better is a true Cinemassacre-style story which I think is the best thing I ever came up with. I was really excited to get started on pre-production, but the liquor store job really kicked my ass.</p>

<h3 id="new-personal-stuff">NEW PERSONAL STUFF</h3>

<p>Next thing, I get a new job. Instead of carrying heavy kegs of beer, I’m now sitting at a computer, editing industrial training videos. Not only do I finally get to do something fairly creative, but the job also supplied me with my own apartment, since the job’s located far from my home.</p>

<p>So there’s been a lot of news with me. New job, new apartment, new car, new girlfriend… what insanity! Just as my life seemed to change for the better, it almost came to a complete end. While driving to work in my new car that I only had for a week, a 24 foot utility trailer came loose from a truck passing in the oncoming lane of traffic. The trailer flew out across the yellow lines on the highway and came right at me! Head-on collision. My new car was smashed like a tin can and totalled, yet I came out alive. To say the least, I’ve been affected a lot by the incident. Naturally, I had to make a movie about it. While I recovered, both physically and mentally, I began cranking out movies once again, so you may notice that the filmography page has been updated a lot since May 2004.</p>

<h3 id="new-movies">NEW MOVIES</h3>

<p>Well, I finished moving into my new place and got back to filmmaking. Most recently, “Beer Man”, “Munky Go Boom”, “Kirk Vs…” (a DVD compilation), “Mechanical Losses” (about the car accident), and “La Momia Mexicana” have all been finished, projects from last summer that I finally caught up with.</p>

<h3 id="new-cinemassacre-vhs-set">NEW CINEMASSACRE VHS SET</h3>

<p>My biggest project has been a restoration process of the classic Cinemassacre films. In summer 2003, I put them all out on DVD ,</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IyDAdLV.jpg" alt="Cinemassacre DVD covers" /></p>

<p>but now I’ve come to the realization that I can’t copy them and the originals barely work anymore. So, I went back to my master tapes, many of them on VHS (when I was editing using two VCR’s), and I re-captured them all onto my computer, this time, saving them all on an external drive. Then, from those files, I made 4 master mini-DV master tapes which I can easily copy onto VHS to give to people now, conveniently. It seems appropriate that after all the formats that these movies have been on, they end up back on VHS where they started.</p>

<p>It seems to me that VHS is the longest lasting, most reliable format. They never have problems like DVD’s.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/c979lq7.jpg" alt="James holding a VHS tape and giving a thumb up." /></p>

<h2 id="say-yes-to-vhs">SAY YES TO VHS</h2>

<h2 id="the-gold-collection-is-out-now">THE GOLD COLLECTION is out now!</h2>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MOSikzd.jpg" alt="Cinemassacre Gold Collection Misfits cover" /></p>

<p>It’s a condensed 4-part set of some of the best Cinemassacre films. Each tape’s about an hour long and is themed roughly.</p>

<p>A CINEMASSACRE MARATHON COLLECTION will follow, but not until a while, since it will take a long time to finish. It’s going to include just about EVERY movie I made that I like. I don’t know how many tapes it’s going to take, but it’ll be chronicalized by year. The six Snix flicks will be on their own tape and there will also be a special Cinemassacre backlot tour as I walk around my house and backyard reflecting on the memories of these old films of mine.</p>

<h3 id="website-updates">WEBSITE UPDATES!!!!</h3>

<p>Well, the most obvious news is that the site’s been finally updated.</p>

<p>A “CURRENT PROJECTS” link has been added, so you can keep up with my new stuff. If you’re helping me out with The Deader the Better, then you should go there to see the storyboards and pre-production material.</p>

<p>Best of all, a “MOVIES” link has been added, so that you can watch some of my short films online. I’ve never tried this before, so let me know if you can’t get the movies to work.</p>

<p>I just got a cable modem recently and a new webserver, dreamhost. Life is getting easier.</p>

<h3 id="new-projects">NEW PROJECTS</h3>

<h3 id="wizard-of-oz-iii-dorothy-goes-to-hell">WIZARD OF OZ III: DOROTHY GOES TO HELL</h3>

<p>STATUS: Editing, animation and special effects.</p>

<p>EXPECTED RELEASE: Summer 2005</p>

<p><em>ANIMATED</em></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kH4qbrD.jpg" alt="Wizard of Oz III: Dorothy Goes to Hell poster" /></p>

<p>If you like my crappy animated films and are a fan of the random Munky Cheez kind of humor, than you will love this one. It’ll be my grand comedy masterpiece!</p>

<h3 id="the-deader-the-better">THE DEADER THE BETTER</h3>

<p>STATUS: Pre-production</p>

<p>EXPECTED RELEASE: Halloween 2005</p>

<p><em>LIVE ACTION</em></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5YvgYiz.jpg" alt="The Deader, The Better poster" /></p>

<p>Finally, I am making what I love best. A black and white atmospheric comedy horror movie about two guys who make a living killing the dead.</p>

<h3 id="the-jersey-odysseys-episode-2">THE JERSEY ODYSSEYS: EPISODE 2:</h3>

<p>STATUS: Writing the script</p>

<p>EXPECTED RELEASE: 2006</p>

<p><em>LIVE ACTION</em></p>

<p>This one’s still under cover, but I can honestly say that I’m really excited about the plot and it’s far better than the Blue Hole. It’s got more action and more intriguing Jersey legends.</p>

<p>The Cinemassacre productions teamed up with Lucky Bastard productions for the Philadelphia <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050905194136/http://www.48hourfilm.com/">48 Hour Film Project</a>. We even took an award for “Best Cinematography.” Good job, everyone. The film, written, directed, and edited in under two days, is titled “Death Seen”, ironically after my last year’s 48 hour film, “The Death Suit.” The genre we drew was Mystery. What we turned out was a creepy tale of a mysterious figure in black following someone, sort of like “The Head Incident” (1999).</p>

<p>One weekend, in May of 1996, I was bored, and inspired by classic silent horror films such as Nosferatu, I decided to make my own movie in my backyard. After that, it became a habit. This weekend, a decade ago, was THE TURNING POINT OF MY LIFE, because I discovered something that I enjoy doing and I wanted to continue making movies for the rest of my life. Today, that desire has not changed at all. I can’t believe that now 10 years have passed and I have come such a long way. Depasquales, thanks for being a part of it and, seriously, can you BELIEVE it was 10 YEARS ago?!</p>

<p>My animated spoof “Wizard of Oz 3” is done!</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/zMyiIJS.jpg" alt="Wizard of Oz III poster" />
Click to view POSTER full screen.</p>

<p>An animated spoof and semi-sequel to “Wizard of Oz” and “Return to Oz.” It’s a mix between South Park, Monty Python and Aqua Teen Hugner Force.</p>

<p>First there was:</p>

<p>“WIZARD OF OZ” (1939)</p>

<p>Dorothy gets stranded in the land of Oz, meets the Scarecrow, Tin Man, &amp; Lion for the first time and kills the Wicked Witch of the East &amp; West.</p>

<p>Then there was:</p>

<p>“RETURN TO OZ” (1985)</p>

<p>Dorothy escapes a psychiatric experiment, fleeing back to Oz and finds that Oz is all fucked up by the Nome King. Famous characters from the first movie are altered, Toto is replaced by a chicken, and everything is dark and twisted.</p>

<p>NOW:</p>

<p>Everything’s going to get EVEN MORE FUCKED UP!</p>

<p>“WIZARD OF OZ 3” (2006)</p>

<p>Dorothy has to go back to Oz again to save her friends from Satan. Now Toto is replaced by Shit Pickle and we get to find out where that red brick road leads to.</p>

<p>My 13th <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/Nes_Nerd.html">“Angry Nintendo (Video Game) Nerd”</a> video is up on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://screwattack.com/">Screwattack.com</a> Go <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://screwattack.com/Flash%20HTML/ANN/Fridaythe13th/Fridaythe13th.html">check it out!</a></p>

<p>The last time Friday the 13th occurred in October was in the year 2000. And I also released a video then as well. It was a music video for Black sabbath. It was edited with two vcr’s. Yes, all the cutting was done without computers. Check it out.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/086_Black_Sabbath.mpg">BLACK SABBATH (2000)</a> 6 min, 25 MB</p>

<p>All of the stock footage is mine, borrowed from my older films. This is one of the last editing jobs I’ve ever done using my primitive two-VCR method, without any computers, not even the title in the beginning. Some of the cutting near the end is so fast, that certain shots last only a fraction of a second which really is amazing, considering it was just two-VCRs.</p>

If you don’t wanna wait for the DVD, you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://void.snocap.com/s/T3-31324-QGXCN3277M-R/">hear it now</a> for $0.99 (US). Think of it as a donation to help us move things forward. We thank you for your support.</p>

<p>No more video game rage there, but don’t worry, it’s for a good cause. I moved and l’m leaving my job to pursue freelance work with more flexible hours so I can cater more to my success as the Angry Video Game Nerd. If you enjoy watching my videos, I can honestly say I enjoy making them as well, but it’s been very difficult to keep up with them on the side of a full time job. To be able to continue, I need some support. I’m releasing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://void.snocap.com/s/T3-31324-QGXCN3277M-R/">new 2 minute 50 second theme song as a 99 cent download</a>. T-shirts are coming soon. And after that, a DVD set compilation of all the nerd videos will be done.</p>

<p>I finished this film a year ago, but wasn’t very experienced with uploading videos to the internet. Now that I’m more knowledged, I’ve re-uploaded the movie in BETTER quality and SMALLER file size! So now you can see it the way it should have been before.</p>

<p>I plan on maybe making a bigger budget feature length sequel/remake sometime hopefully in the future. For now, I’m enjoying much success as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/Nes_Nerd.html">Angry Video Game Nerd</a> and hopefully can use it to branch into my filmmaking career. I think <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/125_TDTB.mov">The Deader the Better</a> was one of my best works, so <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/125_TDTB.mov">check it out.</a></p>

<p>Well, Happy Valentines day. The new video is up! No, it’s not holiday themed, the release date was a coincidence. It’s about the Atari 5200 console and NOT a game review, but a struggle to get the games to work.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/owQvuAp.jpg" alt="Atart 5200 box image" /></p>

<p>Keep your mind open. It’s a little different from most of my videos, but the next few lined up are more traditional angry game reviews. This is the first Angry Video Game Nerd video of 2007! And I know the wait was long, but from here forward, I’ll be making more on a steady basis.</p>

<p>GameTrailers.com, bought Screwattack’s “Video Game Vault” videos, “Top 10” videos and the new Angry Video Game Nerd videos. So that’s where all the new videos will debut. So keep in mind, Screwattack and I are not selling out. Nothing has changed. We will still be making the same kind of videos we’ve always made with our own creative control. The quality is much better on GameTrailers than Youtube’s flash player, anyway. Go there and enjoy the new videos.</p>

<p>MTV flew me and Kyle Justin out to Los Angeles, California to shoot a promo for Gametrailers, Screwattack and myself. It was a surreal event, coming all the way across the country to be recognized on the streets and then later, being a part of the first live screwattack event. Pictures and video will follow later, but for the meantime, listen to it on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://screwattack.com/media/2007/SideScrollers_02_28_07.mp3">SIDESCROLLERS</a>.</p>

<p>I will also post more details about the MTV/GameTrailers promo when available. Overall, it was a great time out here in California, signing autographs to fans, meeting Game Jew and the boys at Screwattack.</p>

<p><em>This was made for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://48hourfilm.com/">48 Hour Film project</a>, a worldwide filmmaking competition in which filmmakers race to finish a movie in less than 48 hours. Teams meet up Friday night and randomly draw a genre from a hat which could be “Action, sci-fi-, horror, superhero, buddy film, historical drama, mockumentary…etc.” Then, every team gets the same 3 things which must appear in the film. A PROP, a CHARACTER, and a LINE OF DIALOGUE. Then the race is off, and the teams must come back in 48 hours with the final film done. All writing, shooting, and editing must happen within those 48 hours.</em></p>

<p><em>It’s always a lot of fun and this was my 4th year in a row entering. After getting “spy”, then, “mystery”, then “spy” again as my genres, I was relieved to get “WESTERN” this time. The curse has finally been lifted. With this, it became much easier to come up with an idea. Also, I rounded up the smallest team possible with only two other teammates, Liam Mulvey and Matt Manahan who I only met last week. We all had a great time, and didn’t stress. No elaborate lighting set-ups like the last years, and no external microphones. It was as low scale as it can get.</em></p>

<p><em>Our emphasis this year was just to make an entertaining little movie that would work well with a large audience. Watching it at the final screening is always a huge laugh fest and it was awkward always having the serious film. This time, we made it funny, and cast my friend Liam’s two sons, Liam (age 6) and Michael (age 3) as the stars. It was challenging and fun at the same time. They’re improvisation took the film in directions we could have never expected, but this also made it diffcult to match cut shots smoothly together. It was like trying to cut a documentary into a cinematic film, so it was a great excercise in editing and not to mention, directing. I brought Kyle Justin in to write a song “I’m just a kid” which he finished in about 3 minutes. It added another dimension of charm to the whole thing. In the end, we were all happy with the movie and had a good time.</em></p>

<p>Hi fans,</p>

<p>I will be away for a couple weeks in July which means there probably won’t be any updates to the site for a while and I won’t be answering many emails til later, so if you tried to reach me, please be patient. But there will be two Angry Video Game Nerd releases as planned. One on the 4th of July, and one on the 18th of July, I believe. So check in here<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://gametrailers.com/screwattack.php">http://gametrailers.com/screwattack.php</a></p>

<p>Back from my trip! Had a good time but a hectic crazy time at E3. Attended the press conferences, met a lot of fans, game designers and website staff. Went to a lot of the after parties, had a lot of free booze, sat 4 seats away from Stan Lee, held a monkey, and played a lot of upcoming games such as Contra 4, Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, Super Mario Galaxy, Castlevania: Dracula X Chronicles, Resident Evil with the Wii Zapper, and the Wii fit games.</p>

<p>If you have 54 minutes to spare, you can see the talk show we did for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://www.thestream.tv/watch.php?v=208">Coin-Op TV</a>. It was LIVE. After a tiring week at E3, I was nearly falling asleep during the show. If you skip to about 31:30, I recite the famous TMNT rant! In a Batman outfit!!!</p>

<p>You can also see our videos from E3, on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://screwattack.com/">ScrewAttack.com</a>, there’s 4 videos on the main page.</p>

<p>The Angry Nerd’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/Nes_Nerd/gallery.html">gallery</a> page has been updated tremendously! Check it out. The fan art is out of control.</p>

<p>Also look out for my Simpsons game review, this week.</p>

<p>and yes, I held a monkey.</p>

<p>The savage werewolf attack in “Rumble in the Jungle.”</p>

<p>Time to dust off 3 Cinemassacre classics from July 1997.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://youtube.com/watch?v=akbceHt45Us">“Feeling of Terror”</a>, a horror movie montage that I put a lot of work into, editing on VHS with analog equipment.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://youtube.com/watch?v=XhzH6k6B8og">“Rumble in the Jungle “</a>. This is just the trailer, edited with two VCR’s. The full movie was a piece of crap.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phDbMl1Q9EU">“Bicycle Speed “</a>. This is just ridiculous and is the first in a series starring goofy characters named Timmy and Jimmy. This is before South Park took my idea! Oh and guess what, there was NO EDITING, all the cuts were made in-camera, then the sound was dubbed in live. (that is while the VHS tape was being copied, we were redubbing our voices and the music was coming from a portable tape player.) Another piece of trivia: we made this movie the same day we did Rumble in the Jungle. Notice the same clothes.</p>

To some fans’ surprise, I dropped no F-bombs. Also, we submitted some of our company’s videos to a contest and swept up some awards. We also went to a fake wedding for the purpose of demonstrating camera techniques. Later that night, I went into “Angry Nerd mode”, or “Crazy Cinemassacre mode” and as a result, we made <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://one.revver.com/watch/363924">this video:</a></p>

<p>* Then, I noticed another nice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071126143128/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/ceb/2007/11/12/life/do.you.play..html">article about me</a>.</p>

<p>* Also, a recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071126143128/http://revver.com/watch/475866/flv/vgxpo-2007/">interview from VGXPO 2007</a> has surfaced, done by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071126143128/http://pbc-productions.com/">PBC Productions.</a></p>

<p>* And last, but certainly not least, the biggest news we’ve all been waiting for:</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071126143128/http://www.ewebcart.com/~12207/cgi-bin/cart.cgi/42210936/GFzNsGbE7FNu2US.dCAYECPmdRGyCBrCtEhwyvw3syU/?p=cart&amp;la=a&amp;ac=view">THE DVD SET IS OUT! Buy it on ScrewAttack.com</a></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KV46rzV.jpg" alt="AVGN DVD cover back" />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0iNPDCh.jpg" alt="AVGN DVD cover front" /></p>

<p>The price is $18.98. Within the U.S., there’s a flat shipping rate of $7.00. Outside the U.S, the shipping rate can vary. Keep in mind, the DVDs are packed with 4 hours of content.</p>

<p>THE BAD NEWS - The movie clips used in the Back to the Future and Rocky reviews have been removed, as well as any other videos that had copyrighted content, including music. I know that may be disappointing, but it would be our ass getting sued. Not yours. The internet is one thing, but when you’re selling it, it can be a different story. Just wanted to end that debate before it starts.</p>

<p>THE GOOD NEWS - To make up for anything that I removed from the videos, I put new stuff in! The Wally bear and Rocky videos have new endings! The Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street videos have a new original soundtrack by Justin Sobers (Zalai.com) and it sounds much better!</p>

<p>NO NEW VIDEOS? - Many people are wondering why none of the videos from 2007 are included. Well, that’s already about 4 hours worth of content right there. Yes, we are planning to release the new videos on DVD eventually. But FIRST, let’s get the old ones out.</p>

<p>Anyway, that’s the news, if you’re someone who helped with the DVD and I already promised you a copy, it will be on the way as soon as I get them. For those who apply, Happy Thanksgiving, and see ya later.</p>

<p>At the moment I type this, <strong>Led Zeppelin</strong> is performing their first full concert since 27 years ago! This is the most historical music event of my lifetime, but it’s a shame that there’s no TV/radio or pay-per-view to air it. After all, it is a benefit concert and would probably raise more money if they put it on pay-per-view. Hopefully a DVD or better yet, a tour will come out of it. But we can only hope. Otherwise, that’s why bootlegs get made and it’s unfortunate.</p>

<p>Hey, I got out to the movies quite a bit lately and paid $10 for the first time on a ticket. For a few dollars more, you can own the DVD, so I really smell the death of movie theaters in the near future, sad to say. But anyway, here’s my thoughts on Cloverfield and the new Rambo.</p>

<p>* Has it been 2 weeks? Well don’t worry, the new nerd video is in the works. Between business, personal life and other projects, it’s just been taking a while to finish. It’s one that I’ve been planning for a long time, I bet you all know what it is.</p>

<p>* I’ve been busy finishing a documentary that will premiere at the Philadelphia Film Festival this April. More info on that later.</p>

<p>* People keep asking what’s up with my YouTube stats. Yes, I’m fully aware. I am still the #8 Most Subscribed Channel of All Time. I have 95,479 subscribers which aren’t going anywhere, but for whatever reason, my honors aren’t showing at the very moment. I don’t know what it is, it could be just a glitch.</p>

<p><strong>HELP ME GET MY WORK SEEN BY GEORGE ROMERO!</strong></p>

<p>* I’ve also been busy re-editing my 17 minute horror film, The Deader The Better, down to 3 minutes for George Romero’s Diary of the Dead contest. I know a lot of you might not be interested in horror films, but regardless, if you want to do me the biggest favor you possibly can, then please vote for my film. The contest seems a bit confusing, but I think all you have to do is rank my video (and I just send a message to the Diary of the Dead Myspace with a link to the video). The top 10 ranked films will be watched and judged by George Romero himself! In case you don’t know, he’s the great grandfather of the zombie film genre (“Night of the Living Dead” (1968), “Dawn of the Dead” (1978)… etc.) The winning video will be featured on the Diary of the Dead DVD. Just the idea of one of my all time favorite directors taking a look at my work is a dream come true. Please help make it happen and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091113081749/http://myspacetv.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoid=27687546">vote for The Deader the Better!</a></p>

<p>A psychological journey through the tormented mind of an art student. I made this during my Freshman year of college. It wasn’t school-related, so it was nearly impossible to get it done on top of my regular assignments. Sometimes while filming, we were literally walking to class and making the movie at the same time. The end result may be rushed and sloppy, but it’s interesting to see the ideas you can come up with when you just let loose. This movie’s open for interpretation.</p>

<p>In memory of Ben Chapman</p>

<p>[Image missing from archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20080319075612im_/http://cinemassacre.com/NEWS/images/ben.jpg]</p>

<p>So I was making plans for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080319075612/http://monstermania.net/">Monster Mania convention</a> when it came to my attention that Ben Chapman passed away on February 21st, 2008.</p>

<p>[Image missing from archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20080319075612im_/http://cinemassacre.com/NEWS/images/creature.jpg]</p>

<p>He played the Creature from the Black Lagoon (land scenes) which makes him one of the last of the Universal Monsters. (Ricou Browning played the creature underwater.)</p>

<p>He’s been making live appearances and greeting fans ever since. He will be missed.</p>

<p>So here’s a tribute I edited in 1995, using two VCR’s. It’s crap and I never intended on showing it to anyone, but now it seems appropriate.</p>

Digital Press was awesome. It’s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://digitpress.com/">gaming store in Clifton, NJ</a>. I stopped by, greeted a lot of fans. Bought some retro games and was interviewed on the spot for the Herald News along with store owner Joe and also with Brett (“Captain S” of PBC Productions).</p>

<p>I’ve SORT OF been featured on Rolling Stone’s website. They have an article where they mention Nightmare on Elm Street (the movie series).

<h2 id="6-heads-up-on-the-new-nerd-video">6) Heads up on the new Nerd video!</h2>

<p>Some fans have suggested I do something big for my “50th video”. I even got this piece of art from Iain.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9ugWAmh.jpg" alt="AVGN 50th video fan art" /></p>

<p>But is it really my 50th? It depends if you count the Top 10 Nerd Moments, 2-part videos, and stuff like that. I personally don’t consider it 50 yet. But either way, I can answer one thing. It’s going to be a huge review. My wishes are to get back to doing shorter videos and go for the famous “quality over quantity”, but I can’t help it when I have so much to say. So expect it to be long, expect it to take another week or so to get done. And hopefully, after that, expect my reviews to be SHORTER from time to time.</p>

<p>So that’s the “Nerd News” for the day. That’s the way the cookie crumbles. That’s the way the diarrhea hits the fan!</p>

<p>If you’re sending fan art, I have to ask a few things.</p>

<p>* Please stop naming the files “AVGN” or “NERD”. Every time I have more than one file with the same name, I have to change one of them. Just trust me, it’s a hassle, so please try to use unique file names.</p>

<p>* If possible, make it a jpeg. Otherwise, I have to change it.</p>

<p>* Enough Mii’s, Simpsons or South Park characters of me. And putting my face on a game box is being done to death too. Don’t get the wrong idea. I love that you’re doing fan art and the videos have made such an impression on you. But too much of the same thing is unnecessary.</p>

<p>My film The Deader the Better, didn’t win, but “went the distance” to the first round of finalists so it’s an incredible honor just to have it seen by George Romero! It was largely influenced by the original Night of the Living Dead and a tribute to the zombie genre as a whole. I spent two years of my life making that film (the 17 minute version), building the cemetery set, all the props, and home-made special effects, so it’s nice to know that the work paid off. I thank everyone for helping out, but I also regret that there was a lot of negative feedback toward my film. It seems lots of people felt I had an unfair advantage with my internet celeb fanbase, so much that the official rules were changed. However, I’m not the only famous person to enter. There’s Teller who I’m also a big fan of. I’ve entered a lot of contests before and things always get competitive and cruel. People don’t treat others films with creative criticism. Everybody just wants to win, so they’ll do whatever they can to tear the others down. I apologize if any of my own fans did the same. I asked them to vote UP my film, not vote DOWN others. Anyway, congrats on the finalists, you can see them here. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://www.myspace.com/diaryofthedead">MySpace.com/DiaryoftheDead</a></p>

<p>I spent about 9 hours yesterday fixing my site. What a pain in the ass.</p>

<p>First of all, there were many pictures not showing up in my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/Nes_Nerd/gallery/">Fan Art Gallery</a>, So I ended up having to look through over 300 files and deleting any of them which had spaces. Spaces seem to cause a bizarre “%20” thing that just fucks everything up. Isn’t web design great? Picky motherfuckin’ bastard! So anyway, it should all work now. If you’re gonna send fan art, please:</p>

<p>1) don’t use spaces.</p>

<p>2) always use jpegs.</p>

<p>3) try to use unique file names. No “Nerd” or “AVGN”.</p>

<p>Doesn’t it suck to have so many rules? Fuck the web. Fuck it to hell!</p>

<p>Also I fixed up my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://cinemassacre.com/AVGN/Nes_Nerd_videos.html">VIDEOS PAGE</a>, which took the majority of the 9 hours. I think it looks a lot better now, but I know there’s probably going to be a bunch of bad links. There always is. So let me know if you find anything wrong. (TheCinemassacre@yahoo.com)</p>

<p>“Top 10 Jackie Chan Stunts” got over a million views, in less than 2 weeks. Damn! That’s gotta be a record for me, even for AVGN standards!</p>

<p>Next will be Top 10 Jackie Chan Fight Scenes. I’ll probably post it sometime in May, because April is going to be Rocky month! Speaking of Rocky month, I will be posting the 6 Rocky reviews on my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://www.youtube.com/user/cinemassacre">“Cinemassacre” YouTube channel.</a> My documentary Rocky Jumped a Park Bench will be on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://www.youtube.com/user/JamesNintendoNerd">“JamesNintendoNerd” channel</a> sometime near the end of April, and most likely, in 2 parts. Sorry for the confusion.</p>

<p>I might to get around to doing some email tonight, but afterwards, I’m concentrating on the next Nerd video. Then I’m eating whale turds and covering myself in dog shit.</p>

<p>What is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://48hourfilm.com/">48 Hour film Project?</a></p>

<p>Filmmaking teams have
just one weekend to make a short film.
All creativity—writing, shooting,
editing and adding a musical
soundtrack—must occur in a 48 hour
window beginning Friday evening at
7 and ending Sunday at 7. The
following week, the completed films
are screened to an eager audience.
Each team draws a genre out of a hat,
such as Sci-Fi, Horror, Western, Spy,
Road Movie, Super Hero, Mockumentary
and every team is given a prop, a line of
dialogue, and a character which all must
be included in the finished film.</p>

Afterwards, I’m going to Vietnam and Afghanistan to film the locations from the Rambo series… No, just kidding. There’s my April Fools joke for the year.

<p>Many people are asking how the screening went. Well, it went perfect! The crowd was cheering and laughing all the way through. Here’s a few clips, so you can see for yourself. Yeah, I bootleged my own movie! Consider it a sneak preview.</p>

<p>[Broken flash embed]</p>

<p>A Q&amp;A session happened afterwards, kind of abruptly, so I didn’t have a chance to pass the camera for someone to record it. Afterwards, in the lobby, I found myself surrounded by an amazing crowd of fans. I autographed NES games, Gameboy Advance SPs, and got pictures with many of them. Thanks for coming out! Thanks to the film festival for an outstanding technical presentation. The picture and sound quality was amazing. It was part of the Rocky Balboa Picture show, a showcase of films based around Rocky and/or the identity of Philadeplhia. FRANKIE13 VS. THE WORLD (site?) (by James Eowan &amp; Douglas Shaffer) was about an underdog like Rocky, taking on a worldwide competition in a Rock, Paper, Scissors tournament! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091114232448/http://www.thisismycheesesteak.com/">THIS IS MY CHEESESTEAK</a> (by Ben Daniels) was about the city’s obsession with the cheesesteak, a food we can eat any day, any time. It brings together all the major steak shop owners in town. I found it very affectionate, humorous and deeply identifiable. Many people asked me about buying DVD’s of Rocky Jumped a Park Bench. To obtain clearances from the locations, song rights, and movie clips would probably be impossible. After all, it’s just something I did for fun, to pay tribute to the Rocky movies and its association with the city of Philadelphia. It’s NON-PROFIT, and will be available free of charge on YouTube and various outlets online (Part 1 on April 25. Part 2 on April 30) Consider it a service to all the Rocky fans. It would be nice to see it full quality, so maybe I’ll post a big full resolution download if I can figure out how to do it.</p>

<p>No, it’s not real. It’s fan-made. Like I said in my Rocky Balboa review, the music of Survivor and the Rocky films go together like bread and butter.</p>

<p>Since 2006 marked the return of Rocky and Survivor, it would have been fitting if they included a new Survivor song in the new Rocky movie. That didn’t happen, so here’s my idea of what it would have been like, and hey, it’s not too late for Rocky 7. Just kidding.</p>

<p>My favorite song off the album is “Fire Makes Steel”, but I chose the title track “Reach” because it fit the montage the best.</p>

<h2 id="new-avgn-links">New AVGN links:</h2>

<p>Keeping up with this stuff is a full time chore, let alone MAKING THE VIDEOS! This website, in case you don’t know, is run by me alone. And for the amount of traffic I’ve gotten, which just keeps on accelerating, it’s an amazing accomplishment for a shitty website run by one person! But not for long, I’m getting help.</p>

<p>A few months ago, I met with a new web designer whom I’ll introduce later. He’ll be helping me take care of this stuff, so sometime this month, we will be launching a revised CineMassacre.com. Same place, new look. Coming soon.</p>

<p>Anyway, here’s 3 updates.</p>

<p>1) Theme song covers:</p>

<p>3) New AVGN game being worked on:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OyAqXjw.jpg" alt="AVGN Game Over Coming Soon" /></p>

<p><em>‘Hello, I am Gavin MacLean. I am currently in the early stages of developing a new AVGN computer game! I have here some artwork I made, two video download links, one leading to a video showing the intro to the game, the other leading to a sneak peek video featuring basic game play. (Note: videos are in avi format and the sneak peek is outdated, meaning many changes have already been made since it was made) Enjoy them, I will send new stuff to the nerd when I can and if you have any idea’s for me, comments, or fan mail, send your e-mails to avgnLordGavin@yahoo.com. Enjoy!’</em></p>

<p>Here are the two videos:</p>

<p>This is a video I’ve been holding onto for a while,</p>

<p>I made it last December, so stop asking about the “2007” logo.</p>

<h2 id="avgn-dvd-link">AVGN DVD LINK?</h2>

<p>I’m getting a lot of questions about the AVGN DVD Vol 1. Why aren’t the links working? Right now, ScrewAttack is updating their site which means there will probably be a new merchandise page. As soon as they have that ready, I’ll fix my links.</p>

<p>I’m also aware that some of the video links aren’t working. They’ll be fixed too.</p>

<h2 id="rocky-jumped-a-park-bench">Rocky Jumped a Park Bench</h2>

<h2 id="in-full-quality">IN FULL QUALITY</h2>

<p>My 27 minute Rocky documentary / tour of all the Philadelphia filming locations, is now available in full quality thanks to Pierre-Luc Delisle.</p>

<p>STEP 1: Download the torrent here. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091114232448/http://thepiratebay.org/search/Rocky%20jumped%20a%20park%20bench%20/0/99/0">http://thepiratebay.org/search/Rocky%20jumped%20a%20park%20bench%20/0/99/0</a></p>

<p>STEP 2: Download a torrent program.
For example <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091114232448/http://azureus.sourceforge.net/">http://azureus.sourceforge.net/</a>: or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091114232448/http://www.utorrent.com/">http://www.utorrent.com/</a></p>

<p>STEP 3: Drop the torrent into your program and begin downloading the whole 1 GB file. If you’re familiar with how torrents work, at this point, it should be a piece of cake. Personally, I’m not too familiar, and its my first time using them. You can read more about torrents on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091114232448/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_%28protocol%29">wikipedia.</a></p>

<p>STEP 4: Watch the movie. The torrent has only one file, the DVD image in .iso format. So either burn it to DVD using a DVD burning program like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091114232448/http://www.nero.com/enu/nero8-introduction.html">Nero</a> for example or if you want to watch on your computer WITHOUT burning a DVD, download <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091114232448/http://vlcplayer-download.info/?gclid=COPQ5MiRmpMCFQFlHgodAwrsZQ">VLC player</a> and watch it on there.</p>

<p>STEP 5: Please “seed” the torrent. Sorry I can’t offer much explanation to that. But if you know what I’m talking about, you’ll know it helps share the file around and distrubute the data. Right now, Pierre-Luc is using all his own bandwith to keep the file active. Basically, just keep the downloaded torrent in your “downloaded files”.</p>

<p>Thanks! And as always, you can still watch it on YouTube.</p>

<h2 id="next-avgn-video-may-21st">NEXT AVGN VIDEO: May 21st</h2>

<p>Lots of people seem to be confused by the ending of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091114232448/http://www.gametrailers.com/player/34014.html">“NES Accessories”</a>. It hints at R.O.B. the one important accessory I left out. But no, I am NOT planning a review of R.O.B. anytime soon. When I do, it’ll be epic and will take a lot of time to make. For now, I’m trying to give myself a break and focus on reviewing basic games, instead of console reviews, game peripherals or giant compilations. Mark my words at the end of the video “save it til later.”</p>

<p>If the hat and the music didn’t clue some of you in, maybe this picture will make it more clear.</p>

I just got real overwhelmed and was too busy to schedule anything. Mostly I’ve just been doing text-based interviews since I can do them at my leisure. But basically I just wanted to say it’s great that so many websites / radio shows want to talk to me, but I’ve just been too busy. So if you’ve been waiting, I apologize, and if you think I may not be interested, I’m just taking an extremely long time to get back to you.</p>

<p>The Iron Man of Gaming event went well. I signed a ton of autographs, took pictures with fans, did a Q&amp;A, and auctioned some of my AVGN props for charity, for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091114225953/http://www.getwellgamers.org/">Get Well Gamers Foundation.</a> The props were: a Nerd shirt, one of several worn in the videos, the bald skin cap worn as Uncle Fester in my Fester’s Quest video, and the beard worn as the old Nerd of the future in the Christmas Carol video. I would’ve brought more, but couldn’t fit much in my luggage.</p>

<p>If you want me to autograph something, you can bring it. You can get pictures with me. Whatever, we’re just hanging out. I’ll be playing some good ol’ gaming action with PBC Productions at 6pm. You can arrive whenever you’d like, I THINK I’ll be there between 2pm and 8pm.</p>

<p>It’s the 50th anniversary of the release of the cult classic The Blob which was filmed in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. One of the movie’s key scenes takes place at the Colonial Theatre. Every year, the theatre celebrates “BlobFest”. I will be showing up TONIGHT AND TOMORROW. If you’re around the area, and happen to be a fan of The Blob, stop by. I might be conducting interviews. So if you wanna be in a CineMassacre Production, come on over!</p>

<p>BOTTOM LINE:</p>

<p>I thought Dark Knight was great! (4 stars)</p>

<p>I thought Batman Begins was good (3 stars)</p>

<p>However, I have several nitpicks about Batman Begins which are all addressed in the video. So if you hate me over it, please don’t miss these comments.</p>

<p>BATMAN BEGINS</p>

<p>- 8:00 “I know I’m completely a minority on this”</p>

<p>-7:50 “Should I voice my honest opnion? Whether you agree or not…”</p>

<p>-4:07 “Now after all my complaining, you probably think I hate this movie, but no, I didn’t. In fact, I was able to sit through it 3 times, which says a lot for me. What I’m doing is what you call nitpicking.”</p>

<p>-3:35 “So relax. It’s my own opinion and at least I gave my reasons. I didn’t mean to bash it, but it already gets enough praise as it is.”</p>

<p>I gave it 3 tumblers (stars) which means Good.
THE DARK KNIGHT</p>

<p>-2:48 “It was pretty good.”</p>

<p>-0:47 “heath Ledger did a great job.”</p>

<p>-0:14 “Overall, pretty good.”</p>

<p>I gave it 4 pencils in the eye (stars) which means Very good.</p>

<p>So what this proves is that the internet is a pathetic dictatorship. I think the Christopher Nolan Batman movies are very well made, but if you give them anything less than 5 stars, 10 out of 10, A + perfect rating, you get roasted.</p>

<p>“OPINIONS” are neither right nor wrong. Go look it up in the dictionary.</p>

<p>Gavin MacLean has been working on an AVGN game for a while, titled “AVGN: Game Over”. He has some things he would like to say to the fans regarding progress of the game and need for a song. I finally have time to post his updates and pics, but I decided to put them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081222062204/http://cinemassacre.com/AVGN/other/Game-Over/Game_Over.html">all here on one convenient page.

<h2 id="dark-side-of-the-nerd-sync">“Dark Side of the Nerd” sync.</h2>

<p>[Image missing from archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20081208213642im_/http://cinemassacre.com/NEWS/images/dark-side-of-the-moon-pink-floyd-poster.jpg]</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5PaEQHC.jpg" alt="AVGN playing SNES next to The Cowardly Lion" /></p>

<p>Some fans already have discovered this, but this is the first time I’m making an official statement. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081208213642/http://www.gametrailers.com/player/31528.html">The AVGN Wizard of Oz game review</a> can be synced to the Pink Floyd album Dark Side of the Moon. But I’m very surprised how many people are not aware of the pop culture reference. So, I’ll explain:</p>

<p>There’s an old urban legend that if you listen to the album Dark Side of the Moon while watching the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, they sync together. During the MGM logo in the beginning of the movie, you’re supposed to start the album on the third lion roar. While a lot of really neat coincidences occur, it’s nothing that special, but some people swear that Pink Floyd dilerberately composed the whole album to match the movie. Furthermore, it’s been discussed in depth to the point where people are even comparing the album artwork, that the beam of light going through the prism, represents the movie’s change from Black &amp; White to Color, and “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.”</p>

<p>So keeping with tradition, you can also sync the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081208213642/http://www.gametrailers.com/player/31528.html">AVGN: Wizard of Oz video</a> to Dark Side of the Moon. You must start the album on the third lion ROAR, ignoring the laughs and various noises inbetween. Or just watch the bottom of the screen for the “I” “II” “III” count to show up. (Start it ON “III”) And just for a fun fact, if you want to know what all the junk at the bottom means: “MMVIII = 2008, the year the video was released. MCMLXXIII = 1973, the year Dark Side of the Moon was released. Plus the prism logo are all the clues presented. This was just to give fans the idea without explicitly saying so.</p>

<p>All the things to watch for:</p>

<p>TIMECODE MATCHES WITH GAMETRAILERS VERSION.</p>

<p>TIMECODE CORRESPONDS WITH VIDEO, NOT ALBUM</p>

<p>0:00 – starts on GameTrailers/Screwattack logo</p>

<p>0:13 – Third lion roar (START ALBUM)</p>

<p>1:29 - First chord of Breathe – Nerd appears for first time.</p>

<p>2:20 – music matches with witch bubble</p>

<p>2:45 - “breathe in the air” – clouds appear on “air”.</p>

<p>3:14 - “how you fly.” – Zooms in on bird flying.</p>

<p>3:18 - “Smiles you’ll give, and tears you’ll cry.” – Tree SMILES, TEAR drops from bubble</p>

<p>3:22 - “all you touch and all you see.” – Nerd TOUCHES clock, EYE appears in background on center poster.</p>

<p>3:29 - “Run, rabbit run” – Very obvious.</p>

<p>3:36 - “Dig that hole, get the sun.” - HOLE in ground, SUN appears at top.</p>

<p>3:54 - “Don’t sit down” – You wouldn’t want to sit down in a killer chair</p>

<p>4:05 - “Ride the tide” – Dorothy rides the logs.</p>

<p>4:10 - “balanced on the biggest wave.” Dorothy jumps on edge of mushroom resembling a wave.</p>

<p>4:13 – “ON THE RUN” BEGINS – Super Mario World starts</p>

<p>6:10 - Crazy laughter – Lion LAUGHS in closeup.</p>

<p>7:05 - another laugh – this time it’s chattering teeth.</p>

<p>7:17 - plane engine (?) – A plane flies by in background, deliberatley added. It doesn’t belong in the game, but perfectly compliments the soundtrack.</p>

<p>8:07 – BELLS!!! – The clock. From here on out, the video repeatedly cuts to the music.</p>

<p>10:32 “in your home town” – Dorothy goes home.</p>

<p>There’s also a very brief scene in the video where you can see R.O.B. hanging himself in the background, but I hope I don’t have to explain what that one’s all about.</p>

<h2 id="updates-from-me">Updates from me:</h2>

<p>The AVGN Batman conclusion should be up Monday.</p>

<p>The Deadly Towers video will be next, sometime before the end of August. It’s the first “fan interactive” video where I’m building the script based off of emails. If you’re one of the lucky ones, I hope you enjoy hearing me use your words. But for everyone else, I want to thank you for sending stuff. I wish I could read all of them, but there’s 6,476 emails, last time I checked. So it would be impossible for me to get through them all. There’s also no judgement factor in choosing the quotes. It just depended on what I felt worked best for the video.</p>

<p>I’ve also been very hard at work on the AVGN Volume 2 DVD. I’m glad to see it finally coming together. More details to come. But I’ll say one thing…. triple disc!</p>

<p>I’m back. I’ve just really been burning myself out with all these videos, so I took a much needed rest. While I was away, the new Nerd video was released already. I had no idea it would be so soon.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081217050428/http://www.gametrailers.com/player/38566.html"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XNElVFn.jpg" alt="AVGN Deadly Towers cover" /></a></p>

<p>As you probably already know, the whole script for the video was based off of fan emails. It was a fun little experiment and I hope you enjoy it. It was fun for me, and challenging to arrange quotes and to keep a flow and construct the video without using any of my own words. (there are a few of my own words to join some of the topics, but 99% is all the fans.) I do have to say, I scanned through as many of the 6,000 + emails as I possibly could, picking out anything I thought stood out. I’ve read a lot of really bizarre stuff. The next video is also a little different, but instantly one of my favorites. I look forward to you seeing it.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for many many more pictures/videos/links coming up soon. I’m gonna be on a steady roll. Thanks, Matt for the update while I was away.</p>
