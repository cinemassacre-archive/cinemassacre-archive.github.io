  <p class="gold">Old site description:</p>
  <p>I was hanging out in my next door neighbors’ backyard one day and they said they were in the mood to be in another movie, so we made this quick improvised crime/comedy about two dumb, lazy, undercover cops who are in search of an insane, hyperactive, equally stupid, masked serial killer who’s running around shooting people while hooked on a terrible potion, which he’s invented to give him power. The killer stands four feet tall wearing a paper mask and sombrero! It was so funny, we had to make a sequel the next day. Both are 8 minutes long and run back to back. They’re both usually referred to as the same movie. I now had an audio dubbing remote control for my camera, so this is the first movie where I dubbed in music and experimented with post-production sound effects and voices.</p>











<p class="gold">James's old ratings:</p>

<p>Back in 2003 James included star ratings with each film he listed on his filmography on his website.</p>

<p>Later on he switched to ratings out of ten.</p>

<p>Eventually, he dropped the ratings entirely.</p>
