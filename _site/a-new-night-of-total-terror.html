  <p class="gold">Old site description:</p>
  <p>This was my first experience with using 16mm film instead of video. Visual arts majors at my school are forced to go through a “foundation” program where you are stuck drawing, sculpting, painting and doing everything. I had one film class for an elective and no emphasis was placed on narrative structure or editing. The only assignment was to shoot off a 3 minute roll of film on a simple action and explore the different ways to depict it, places to move the camera and lighting setups. I was the only student in the class who did a narrative and at first everybody thought I was crazy, but I pulled it off. Everybody in the class wore monster masks and had lots of fun.</p>











<p class="gold">James's old ratings:</p>

<p>Back in 2003 James included star ratings with each film he listed on his filmography on his website (the text under the star rating was his description of what the star rating meant). Later on he switched to ratings out of ten.</p>

<p>Eventually, he dropped the ratings entirely.</p>
