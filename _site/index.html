<p>This is still very much a work in progress. I don’t know when it will be done (or up to date I suppose would be a better term) because this is just a side project I’m working on. I’ll update it over time, and eventually it’ll probably get there.</p>

<p>The goal here is mostly just to collect and display everything, not so much to preserve it meticulously.</p>

<p>Where possible I’ll link to official sources. Where the official sources have been removed I’ll link elsewhere.</p>

<p>The design will change soon, especially for video pages. What I’m using now is a quickly thrown together thing. It likely won’t get much more complicated, but it will hopefully look nicer when I style and arrange things properly. For now the main effort is being put into collecting all of the stuff to populate the pages.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the topic of old thumbnails:</p>

<p>I don’t care much about the thumbnails, but I know some do, so I ran a script to try to grab them from the Wayback Machine, but the results there varied as the script was not exactly sophisticated or any good.</p>

<p>For some I think I got all of the old thumbnails. For others I got nothing. I’m still in the process of sorting through those, but once they’re up if someone else wants to go back through to help get the ones that are missing, send them along, and I’ll include them.</p>

<p>The issue is that actually going through and getting all of them would be a very tedious job, so I don’t think I’ll be doing it. Plus, the end result would mostly just be random frames that YouTube selected, box art, and in some cases James or Mike holding the cartridge in front of the camera. I’m not convinced much of anyone would even look at them or care.</p>
