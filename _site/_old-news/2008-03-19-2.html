<h2 id="whats-the-point-of-having-two-news-pages">What’s the point of having TWO NEWS PAGES?!</h2>

<p>It’s too much trouble for me to keep up with both the AVGN news page and the CINEMASSACRE news page, so I’m combining the two! Why not? From now on, every update I make, whether it’s AVGN related or not, will be on this one page.</p>
