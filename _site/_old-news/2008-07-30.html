<p>Gavin MacLean has been working on an AVGN game for a while, titled “AVGN: Game Over”. He has some things he would like to say to the fans regarding progress of the game and need for a song. I finally have time to post his updates and pics, but I decided to put them <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081222062204/http://cinemassacre.com/AVGN/other/Game-Over/Game_Over.html">all here on one convenient page. So check it out.</a></p>
