<p>My <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/Nes_Nerd.html">Angry Nintendo Nerd</a> character has gained more popularity than anything I’ve ever managed. I’m being talked about all over the internet. Just try a google search and see what I mean. My videos on YouTube have already surpassed 10,000 views each. TMNT actually passed 21,000!</p>

<p>Also, Happy Birthday to me, I’m 26.</p>
