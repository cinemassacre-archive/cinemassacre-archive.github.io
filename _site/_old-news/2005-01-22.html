<h2 id="my-first-update-since-may-2004">MY FIRST UPDATE SINCE MAY 2004</h2>

<p>Well let me sum things up. I’ve been busy as friggin’ hell.</p>

<h3 id="graduation-aftermath">GRADUATION AFTERMATH</h3>

<p>Last May, I finished my senior film “The Jersey Odysseys: Episode I: Legend of the Blue Hole” and graduated from the University of the Arts.</p>

<p>Following my graduation, I got a job at a liquor store, during the summer, where I basically rotted myself away. All I did was stock the same shelves, day after day, while everybody around me talked about cars, girls, and sports. It was so boring, because I was used to being around creative artistic people.</p>

<h3 id="jersey-odysseys-dvd-postponed">JERSEY ODYSSEYS DVD POSTPONED</h3>

<p>On my spare time, I worked on a Jersey Odysseys DVD, complete with a trailer, deleted scenes, director commentary and a bonus films. I finished the DVD and was planning to give copies out to everybody involved with the film, but I realized that I was having a lot of trouble copying them. First of all, it took too long and, second, they never played right. They always skipped and froze, so I apologize to everybody for saying that I was going to give you a DVD when I never did, but I’m STILL trying to get my tech problems worked out.</p>

<h3 id="new-dream-project">NEW DREAM PROJECT</h3>

<p>Also over the summer, I was working on a new horror movie script entitled “The Deader the Better.” While plans to make another Jersey Odysseys episode went on halt for the meantime, I was really excited about this new idea. The Deader the Better is a true Cinemassacre-style story which I think is the best thing I ever came up with. I was really excited to get started on pre-production, but the liquor store job really kicked my ass.</p>

<h3 id="new-personal-stuff">NEW PERSONAL STUFF</h3>

<p>Next thing, I get a new job. Instead of carrying heavy kegs of beer, I’m now sitting at a computer, editing industrial training videos. Not only do I finally get to do something fairly creative, but the job also supplied me with my own apartment, since the job’s located far from my home.</p>

<p>So there’s been a lot of news with me. New job, new apartment, new car, new girlfriend… what insanity! Just as my life seemed to change for the better, it almost came to a complete end. While driving to work in my new car that I only had for a week, a 24 foot utility trailer came loose from a truck passing in the oncoming lane of traffic. The trailer flew out across the yellow lines on the highway and came right at me! Head-on collision. My new car was smashed like a tin can and totalled, yet I came out alive. To say the least, I’ve been affected a lot by the incident. Naturally, I had to make a movie about it. While I recovered, both physically and mentally, I began cranking out movies once again, so you may notice that the filmography page has been updated a lot since May 2004.</p>

<h3 id="new-movies">NEW MOVIES</h3>

<p>Well, I finished moving into my new place and got back to filmmaking. Most recently, “Beer Man”, “Munky Go Boom”, “Kirk Vs…” (a DVD compilation), “Mechanical Losses” (about the car accident), and “La Momia Mexicana” have all been finished, projects from last summer that I finally caught up with.</p>

<h3 id="new-cinemassacre-vhs-set">NEW CINEMASSACRE VHS SET</h3>

<p>My biggest project has been a restoration process of the classic Cinemassacre films. In summer 2003, I put them all out on DVD ,</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/IyDAdLV.jpg" alt="Cinemassacre DVD covers" /></p>

<p>but now I’ve come to the realization that I can’t copy them and the originals barely work anymore. So, I went back to my master tapes, many of them on VHS (when I was editing using two VCR’s), and I re-captured them all onto my computer, this time, saving them all on an external drive. Then, from those files, I made 4 master mini-DV master tapes which I can easily copy onto VHS to give to people now, conveniently. It seems appropriate that after all the formats that these movies have been on, they end up back on VHS where they started.</p>

<p>It seems to me that VHS is the longest lasting, most reliable format. They never have problems like DVD’s.</p>

<p>It’s a condensed 4-part set of some of the best Cinemassacre films. Each tape’s about an hour long and is themed roughly.</p>

<p>A CINEMASSACRE MARATHON COLLECTION will follow, but not until a while, since it will take a long time to finish. It’s going to include just about EVERY movie I made that I like. I don’t know how many tapes it’s going to take, but it’ll be chronicalized by year. The six Snix flicks will be on their own tape and there will also be a special Cinemassacre backlot tour as I walk around my house and backyard reflecting on the memories of these old films of mine.</p>

<h3 id="website-updates">WEBSITE UPDATES!!!!</h3>

<p>Well, the most obvious news is that the site’s been finally updated.</p>

<p>A “CURRENT PROJECTS” link has been added, so you can keep up with my new stuff. If you’re helping me out with The Deader the Better, then you should go there to see the storyboards and pre-production material.</p>

<p>Best of all, a “MOVIES” link has been added, so that you can watch some of my short films online. I’ve never tried this before, so let me know if you can’t get the movies to work.</p>

<p>I just got a cable modem recently and a new webserver, dreamhost. Life is getting easier.</p>

<h3 id="new-projects">NEW PROJECTS</h3>

<h3 id="wizard-of-oz-iii-dorothy-goes-to-hell">WIZARD OF OZ III: DOROTHY GOES TO HELL</h3>

<p>STATUS: Editing, animation and special effects.</p>

<p>EXPECTED RELEASE: Summer 2005</p>

<p><em>ANIMATED</em></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kH4qbrD.jpg" alt="Wizard of Oz III: Dorothy Goes to Hell poster" /></p>

<p>If you like my crappy animated films and are a fan of the random Munky Cheez kind of humor, than you will love this one. It’ll be my grand comedy masterpiece!</p>

<h3 id="the-deader-the-better">THE DEADER THE BETTER</h3>

<p>STATUS: Pre-production</p>

<p>EXPECTED RELEASE: Halloween 2005</p>

<p><em>LIVE ACTION</em></p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/5YvgYiz.jpg" alt="The Deader, The Better poster" /></p>

<p>Finally, I am making what I love best. A black and white atmospheric comedy horror movie about two guys who make a living killing the dead.</p>

<h3 id="the-jersey-odysseys-episode-2">THE JERSEY ODYSSEYS: EPISODE 2:</h3>

<p>STATUS: Writing the script</p>

<p>EXPECTED RELEASE: 2006</p>

<p><em>LIVE ACTION</em></p>

<p>This one’s still under cover, but I can honestly say that I’m really excited about the plot and it’s far better than the Blue Hole. It’s got more action and more intriguing Jersey legends.</p>
