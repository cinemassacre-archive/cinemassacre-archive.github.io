<p>So I was making plans for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080319075612/http://monstermania.net/">Monster Mania convention</a> when it came to my attention that Ben Chapman passed away on February 21st, 2008.</p>

<p>He played the Creature from the Black Lagoon (land scenes) which makes him one of the last of the Universal Monsters. (Ricou Browning played the creature underwater.)</p>

<p>He’s been making live appearances and greeting fans ever since. He will be missed.</p>

<p>So here’s a tribute I edited in 1995, using two VCR’s. It’s crap and I never intended on showing it to anyone, but now it seems appropriate.</p>
