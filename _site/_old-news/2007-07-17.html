<p>Back from my trip! Had a good time but a hectic crazy time at E3. Attended the press conferences, met a lot of fans, game designers and website staff. Went to a lot of the after parties, had a lot of free booze, sat 4 seats away from Stan Lee, held a monkey, and played a lot of upcoming games such as Contra 4, Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, Super Mario Galaxy, Castlevania: Dracula X Chronicles, Resident Evil with the Wii Zapper, and the Wii fit games.</p>

<p>If you have 54 minutes to spare, you can see the talk show we did for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://www.thestream.tv/watch.php?v=208">Coin-Op TV</a>. It was LIVE. After a tiring week at E3, I was nearly falling asleep during the show. If you skip to about 31:30, I recite the famous TMNT rant! In a Batman outfit!!!</p>

<p>You can also see our videos from E3, on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://screwattack.com/">ScrewAttack.com</a>, there’s 4 videos on the main page.</p>
