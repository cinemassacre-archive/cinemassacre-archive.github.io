<p>I’ll be posting reviews of all 6 of the Rocky films, and maybe some bonus stuff inbetween. By the end of the month, I’ll post my documentary, Rocky Jumped a Park Bench, in which I visit every Philadelphia location from the films, no matter how minor of a scene they appear in. Afterwards, I’m going to Vietnam and Afghanistan to film the locations from the Rambo series… No, just kidding. There’s my April Fools joke for the year. But the Rocky videos are happening for sure!</p>
