<p>My 27 minute Rocky documentary / tour of all the Philadelphia filming locations, is now available in full quality thanks to Pierre-Luc Delisle.</p>

<p>STEP 1: Download the torrent here. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091114232448/http://thepiratebay.org/search/Rocky%20jumped%20a%20park%20bench%20/0/99/0">http://thepiratebay.org/search/Rocky%20jumped%20a%20park%20bench%20/0/99/0</a></p>

<p>STEP 2: Download a torrent program.
For example <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091114232448/http://azureus.sourceforge.net/">http://azureus.sourceforge.net/</a>: or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091114232448/http://www.utorrent.com/">http://www.utorrent.com/</a></p>

<p>STEP 3: Drop the torrent into your program and begin downloading the whole 1 GB file. If you’re familiar with how torrents work, at this point, it should be a piece of cake. Personally, I’m not too familiar, and its my first time using them. You can read more about torrents on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091114232448/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_%28protocol%29">wikipedia.</a></p>

<p>STEP 4: Watch the movie. The torrent has only one file, the DVD image in .iso format. So either burn it to DVD using a DVD burning program like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091114232448/http://www.nero.com/enu/nero8-introduction.html">Nero</a> for example or if you want to watch on your computer WITHOUT burning a DVD, download <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091114232448/http://vlcplayer-download.info/?gclid=COPQ5MiRmpMCFQFlHgodAwrsZQ">VLC player</a> and watch it on there.</p>

<p>STEP 5: Please “seed” the torrent. Sorry I can’t offer much explanation to that. But if you know what I’m talking about, you’ll know it helps share the file around and distrubute the data. Right now, Pierre-Luc is using all his own bandwith to keep the file active. Basically, just keep the downloaded torrent in your “downloaded files”.</p>

<p>Thanks! And as always, you can still watch it on YouTube.</p>
