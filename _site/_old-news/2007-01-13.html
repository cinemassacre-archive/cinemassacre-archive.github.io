<p>Hey nerd fans,</p>

<p>We recorded a new 2 minute 50 second theme song for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://cinemassacre.com/Movies/Nes_Nerd.html">Angry Video Game Nerd</a> which will be on the DVD intro. If you don’t wanna wait for the DVD, you can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://void.snocap.com/s/T3-31324-QGXCN3277M-R/">hear it now</a> for $0.99 (US). Think of it as a donation to help us move things forward. We thank you for your support.</p>

<p>One last look at the Nerd’s old room.</p>

<p>No more video game rage there, but don’t worry, it’s for a good cause. I moved and l’m leaving my job to pursue freelance work with more flexible hours so I can cater more to my success as the Angry Video Game Nerd. If you enjoy watching my videos, I can honestly say I enjoy making them as well, but it’s been very difficult to keep up with them on the side of a full time job. To be able to continue, I need some support. I’m releasing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://void.snocap.com/s/T3-31324-QGXCN3277M-R/">new 2 minute 50 second theme song as a 99 cent download</a>. T-shirts are coming soon. And after that, a DVD set compilation of all the nerd videos will be done.</p>
