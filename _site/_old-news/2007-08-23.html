<p>My first zombie flick. Shot on VHS. Edited on two VCR’s. Kool-Aid blood. And I play the evil “zombie master”. This movie was never finished, but if you’re in the mood for an old school, no budget, backyard production, then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070913235542/http://youtube.com/watch?v=zDvvmgVVsvc">take a look.</a></p>
