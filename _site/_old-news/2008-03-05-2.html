<p>Also I made some updates on my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://cinemassacre.com/AVGN/Nes_Nerd_Linx.html">links</a> page. There’s been 3 new mentions lately and several other requests for interviews in my inbox. If you’re waiting, sorry it’s taking so long. I’m really struggling to catch up with things.</p>

Digital Press was awesome. It’s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://digitpress.com/">gaming store in Clifton, NJ</a>. I stopped by, greeted a lot of fans. Bought some retro games and was interviewed on the spot for the Herald News along with store owner Joe and also with Brett (“Captain S” of PBC Productions).</p>

<p>I’m very behind on the fan art. It’ll get updated sometime soon, I can’t say when. My main priority is getting the videos done. But it’ll be relatively soon.</p>

<p>Also got some shirts sent in the mail by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://combobreaker.com/">ComboBreaker.com. Very cool, check’em out.</a></p>

<p>And I’ve added another fan cover of the AVGN theme song by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091112061649/http://www.mathowlett.com/ears/nerdtune.mp3">Mat Howlett</a></p>

<p>The biggest news I have, as far as my own personal projects go, there will be a 20-25 minute documentary coming soon entitled CineMassacre 200. It’s my 200th movie and is my own retrospective on how I got started making films and how my hobby evolved. It will be posted on YouTube soon.</p>

<p>That’s all for now. Nerd signing out.</p>
