<p class="mikes-notes">Mike's notes:</p>

<p>– For episode 12 the Nerd reviews Friday the 13th on NES</p>

<p>– In this episode I played Jason Voorhees. This is the first time (of many) where I play a character on the series.</p>

<p>– James and I did a commentary on this episode. <a href="/avgn/episode-12-commentary">You can view the commentary here.</a></p>

<p>– Clips from this episode appeared on the DVD for “His Name Was Jason: 30 Years of Friday the 13th (2009)”</p>

<p>– Right before this episode, James made a video called “The Anger Begins” a short where the Nerd looks back to his childhood to discover where the hatred and anger started. Even though Friday the 13th is officially episode 12, it is the 13th video featuring the Nerd character. Also, this video was released on Friday the 13th. (It hit Youtube a week later)</p>

<p class="yt-description">YouTube description</p>

<p>The Nerd prepares for Halloween by taking a look at why the NES game based on Friday the 13th is more frustrating than scary. This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 12.</p>

<p>The 1980’s was a time stacked full of slasher films, but Friday the 13th stood out with its camp setting and countless teen death toll. The face of the movie franchise was the classic goalie mask worn by Jason Voorhees.</p>

<p>Throughout the years many different actors and stunt men played Jason including Ari Lehman, Warrington Gillette, Steve Daskewisz, Richard Brooker, Ted White, Tom Morga, C. J. Graham, Kane Hodder, Ken Kirzinger and Derek Mears.  As of present day there are a total of 12 films including a remake.</p>

<p>Nothing stopped Jason from murderously hacking and slashing dozens of people in these films, and nothing stopped LJN from producing what seems to be a kids game from R rated films. Released in 1989, Friday the 13th for NES was created by Atlus and published by LJN.</p>

<p>With the thought of being stalked by Jason while trying to save kids is already horrible, it’s nothing compared to trying to maneuver using the game map. The game was padded with villains unrelated to the movies including birds, wolves and zombies. When Jason appears with machete in hand it’s enough to make the player jump (if they can stand playing that long) .</p>

<p>During this episode the Nerd is forced to play Friday the 13th by no other than Jason himself under the threat of machete and we learn the horror of Friday the 13th.</p>
