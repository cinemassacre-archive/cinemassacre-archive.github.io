<p>There’s nothing looney about the Nerd’s next review of a bad video game, as he attempts to find fun within Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout for the NES. This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 31.</p>

<p>Bugs Bunny is one of the most important and influential cartoon characters ever. First introduced in 1940, Bugs is best known for starring in the Looney Tunes shorts and has gone on to become an animation icon, the Warner Bros mascot and a recipient of a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. His continued success throughout the generations naturally led to video game adaptations.</p>

<p>Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout is a side-scrolling NES game released by Kemco in 1990. The plot follows Bugs Bunny as he is invited to his 50th birthday party, but along the way runs into his envious Looney Tune friends who try to stop him from getting there. During his travels he also encounters random enemies like walking boxes with the letter “S” on them, and a plethora of exploding alarm clocks. As annoying as these enemies can be, they aren’t too much of a problem because it’s surprisingly hard to die in this game. You can get hit by nearly everything in a stage and still make it out alive. The difficulty level is astonishingly easy and makes for an extremely dull experience.</p>

<p>In this review the Nerd plays through the game, and gets a special visit from the legendary Bugs Bunny himself! Although his legacy of being one the greatest cartoon characters of all time is well deserved, the abuse he receives from the Nerd for the cruel and unusual punishment known as Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout is equally justified.</p>
