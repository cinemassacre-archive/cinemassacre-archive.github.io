  <p class="gold">Old site description:</p>
  <p>I left my audiences of “A Night of Total Terror” with an open ending. I wanted to leave it this way, so people could use their imagination to decide what happens next, but months later, I could not resist the temptation of making this sequel. I devised a more careful storyline and was ready to make my greatest movie yet, but my co-star was always unavailable, so I deleted his scenes and filmed the movie with only myself, as both the actor and camera operator. As a result, the action suffers because of no camera movement and the plot became tasteless. After this, I vowed never to make a sequel again. (besides the six “Snix” flicks) The only thing superior about this sequel is the visual side of it. I used my annual Halloween haunted house exhibit as the set and experimented with blacklights, strobe lights and a severe red floodlight to suggest the fires of hell. The shot of me crawling cross-eyed through a tunnel, covered with spiders and snakes, was classic. Another advancement in this film was my use of sound. Instead of dubbing in any music, I concentrated on spooky sound effects, such as wolves howling, coffins creaking and ghosts moaning to support what was taking place on screen. I tried my best, using two different audio tapes, playing simultaneously, to blend the sounds together and try to give them a seemingly natural flow throughout the film.</p>









<p class="gold">James's old ratings:</p>

<p>Back in 2003 James included star ratings with each film he listed on his filmography on his website.</p>

<p>Later on he switched to ratings out of ten.</p>

<p>Eventually, he dropped the ratings entirely.</p>
