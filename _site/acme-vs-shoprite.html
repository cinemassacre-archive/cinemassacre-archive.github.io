  <p class="gold">Old site description:</p>
  <p>For a highschool project, my friend had to make a television commercial. He decided to do a commercial for Acme and consulted me to help him make it. We ended up turning it into an action thriller where an Acme employee is fighting against a ShopRite employee. It turns into a car chase and climaxes with the Acme dude running over the Shoprite guy and crushing his head, which is actually a stuffed dummy with a watermelon head. Then he gets out of his car, faces the camera and says “Acme always crushes this competition.” I heard that the class loved it, but the teacher said it was too violent.</p>











<p class="gold">James's old ratings:</p>

<p>Back in 2003 James included star ratings with each film he listed on his filmography on his website (the text under the star rating was his description of what the star rating meant). Later on he switched to ratings out of ten.</p>

<p>Eventually, he dropped the ratings entirely.</p>
