  <p class="gold">Old site description:</p>
  <p>Another spontaneous film of mine. Joe and Ed from the neighborhood were hanging out at my back porch, bored out of their minds, so I decided to have them act in a quick spoof of “Speed”(the 1994 action thriller where a bomb is programmed on a bus to explode if the bus travels any slower than 50 mph). In “Bicycle Speed”, two stupid kids are threatened by a bomb on an exercise bike that can’t go above 25 mph. If they simply stop pedaling and get off the bike, they’ll be safe, but they’re too stupid to realize it. The “Timmy” and “Jimmy” characters they invented are hilarious. I wanted to make a series of sequels, using this comedy duo, but only one sequel was finished: 49. TIMMY AND JIMMY PLAY BASKETBALL.</p>




  <p class="gold">Description from Cinemassacre.com:</p>
  <p>The movie that introduced the characters Timmy and Jimmy. 1997.</p>




  <p class="gold">YouTube description:</p>
  <p>This is just ridiculous and is the first in a series starring goofy characters named Timmy and Jimmy. This is before South Park took my idea! Oh and guess what, there was NO EDITING, all the cuts were made in-camera, then the sound was dubbed in live. (that is while the VHS tape was being copied, we were redubbing our voices and the music was coming from a portable tape player.) Another piece of trivia: we made this movie the same day we did Rumble in the Jungle. Notice the same clothes.</p>







<p class="gold">James's old ratings:</p>

<p>Back in 2003 James included star ratings with each film he listed on his filmography on his website.</p>

<p>Later on he switched to ratings out of ten.</p>

<p>Eventually, he dropped the ratings entirely.</p>
