  Aliens from outer space abduct a dinosaur egg, keep it alive and dormant for billions of years and then send it back to Earth, during the present time, where it's discovered by a scientific exhibition. The egg hatches and a baby velociraptor comes out and kills off the scientists. It escapes the lab and runs amuck in the city while it grows larger. There were three phases to its size. I had a baby Jurassic Park raptor figure for the infant. For the second phase, I used an adult sized raptor. For the third and final stage, I used a raptor mask and claws which were supposed to be used in the unfinished "DinoMen From D-4." I only showed the head and claws, obviously, to suggest an enormous sized creature which picks up people off the streets and eats them.
