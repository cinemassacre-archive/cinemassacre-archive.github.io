  A short improvised thriller about a kid who is confronted by unknown terrors of the dark. Very vague and mysterious with a poetic narration. Background sound effects, night shooting and serious attitude gave this little movie a chilling mood, but funny at the same time, making it a Cinemassacre cult classic.
