  Tale of a boy who is chosen by an evil wizard to bring forth the destruction of the world. A black spell is cast while he sleeps which causes all of his dreams to come true. Unfortunatley, he can't help but dream of monsters that kill people. This is my best "illustrated" or "still" movie. (meaning it's more like a comic book that's being read for you. I draw everything and do all the voices and sound effects.)
