  For the English class term paper, most students were writing about whether or not abortion should be legal, but I chose to do something interesting: Cryptozoology which is the search for animals unknown to science. My argue was that there exist creatures that have not yet been verified. For the visual presentation, I made this documentary about Big Foot and the Loch Ness Monster, assembling photographs and film footage while narrating over it.
