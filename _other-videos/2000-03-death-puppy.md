  My friend had this overly playful dog which would always jump all over guests, so I decided to star her in a really bad horror movie. The idea with this film was to purposely make it bad. The continuity goes out of control. A character's hand is bitten off, but somehow grows back. The dog keeps changing breeds. Articles of clothing change. The relationships of the characters change. One of them turns from an unwelcome guest to a close friend, while another turns from a friend to a stranger. You can hear me behind the camera whispering to the actors when they forget their lines. When the dog starts to attack, the main character calls 911, says "My puppy's trying to kill me", then hangs up the phone immediately. Right away, two people barge through the door wearing t-shirts that say "911." I have a personal fondness for this one. It's so bad and so funny.
