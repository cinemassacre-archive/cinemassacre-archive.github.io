  I get possessed by the spirit of Snix and my only hope of driving the demon out is my neighbor to come over and whack me over the head with a golf club. Once defeated, the spirit appears inside the television set where he must confront his rival Xins before departing this dimension. There's some interesting editing and use of flashbacks. Each Snix movie is better than the one before it. As I age from 12 to 17 throughout the series, I grow both physically and mentally as an amatuer filmmaker who keeps improving. Also this is my first movie done on my new editing vcr.
