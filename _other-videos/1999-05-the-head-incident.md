  At the time, this was my masterpiece which I finished the summer after I graduated high school. I put full effort into writing a script, drawing storyboards, and devising special effects. The entire production length was 8 months. It's about psychotherapists who examine an insane man who is haunted by delusions of a possessed disembodied dummy head which floats on air and mysteriously kills people. At first, his crazy story is ridiculed, but when more people start seeing it, they start to doubt his neurotic condition. It's great b-movie fun. Chilling at times, and funny. A bit overlong though.
