  I had an animation elective course where we I made this cut-out action epic. The characters came from magazines which I cut the limbs off of and reassembled with strings behind them to make their arms and legs movable. The star is Jim Carrey in his role as Andy Kaufman in "Man on The Moon" cut from a newspaper ad. Throughout this insane cartoon, he engages in mortal combat with all kinds of other crazy characters.
