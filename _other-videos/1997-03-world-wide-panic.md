  There's a lot of famous landmarks being destroyed or climbed in monster movies. Using footage from some of these films, I edited a little compilation, using two vcrs and dubbed my narration over it. Scenes I used included "The Deadly Mantis" climbing the Washington Monument, "King Kong" climbing the Empire State Building, alien invaders from "Earth Vs. The Flying Saucers" destroying the famous governmental buildings of Washington DC, and the creature Gorosaurus tearing apart the Arc De Triump in "Destroy All Monsters."
