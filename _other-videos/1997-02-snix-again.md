  I was so pleased with "Snix: The Return" that I decided to do one more sequel, so I could call the whole thing "The Snix Trilogy". I tried to make this one the grand finale, however I put too much thought into it. The story was too complex and had to broken up into four more sequels which I eventually called The Six Snix Flicks. (See 98 filmography for Rotten Corpse of Snix, Possessed Mask of Snix and finally The Evil Spirit of Snix.)
