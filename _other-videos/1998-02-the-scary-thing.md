  Joe tried on some of my vampire makeup and before he washed if off, I got out my camera, dimmed the lights and made a quick improvised horror flick about an insane guy who is telling scary stories to himself when a zombie suddenly sneaks into his house. It's kind of creepy and funny at the same time. A Cinemassacre cult classic.
