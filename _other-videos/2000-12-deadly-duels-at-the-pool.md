  Kung fu movie I made in summer 2000. I shot it on VHS and edited with two VCRâ€™s and a title keyboard. It was filmed all in one single day.

  I wanted to make an entertaining action movie, so I casted two friends who knew some martial arts (American Goju and Tai Kwan Do). The movie begins like a gangster film, but turns into a martial arts film halfway through. A villain hires a hit man to kill his rival. It begins with them playing a game of pool and ends with a battle at a swimming pool. For a one day shoot, it came out really good.
