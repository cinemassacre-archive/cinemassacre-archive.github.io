  All of my friends from the neighborhood used to have wrestling matches on a trampoline in their backyard. It was lots of fun, so I began videotaping the fights. The competitors became more dramatic and intense when the camera was on them. At the end of the summer, I edited a greatest "hits" (all the best punches, kicks, slams, etc.) music video with the song "Eye of the Tiger." It was the FIRST EDITING JOB I've ever done! (done using two regular vcr's)
