  This is a Halloween special I made back in 1992 and 1993. It’s a complete mess, but it shows that I always managed to have fun on Halloween, even when I had no one else to spend it with. This is one of the oldest videos I’ve ever made. It has never been seen by anyone besides myself until now. Watch for animation at the end, done on Mario Paint (Super Nintendo)

  I was so enthused about Halloween, I put together this boring disorganized mess to explore the holiday's various themes and try to get people into the spirit. It contains some mini-movies such as one where I am trapped inside a pumpkin. (a closeup of my fingers wiggling out of the jack-o-lantern's mouth) Other segments include some footage of my Halloween party, myself babbling on about classic horror films, footage of my annual Haunted House exhibit, and a music video for "Monster Mash" which actually isn't too bad. I animated several Halloween scenes such as a witch flying on her broomstick across the full moon and a Frankenstein monster rising from a laboratory table. They were all done on the Super NES Mario Paint program and to get the music on them, I had to play back everything I recorded and videotape the TV screen while playing the song on my audio tape player. I should have stacked the camera up on some books, (or heaven help me, a tripod!) but for some reason which is unknown to me today, I held the camera and it shakes like hell.
