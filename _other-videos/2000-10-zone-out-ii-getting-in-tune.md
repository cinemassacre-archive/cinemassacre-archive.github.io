  At the end of the last semester of Freshmen year, my friend Gina and I decided to make a sequel to our improvised Zone Out which was made at the beginning of the first semester. Again, there's no logic or plot to this surreal work of art, but it subconsciously shows what we went through during the year and how we've changed since the first Zone Out. See also 65. ZONE OUT.
