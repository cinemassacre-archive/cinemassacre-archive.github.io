  I made this movie in 1997, shot on VHS and edited on two VCR’s like all my old movies. It sucked, but I did a pretty good job on the trailer.

  A group of people are stranded on a jungle island where a harmful mixture of chemicals was dropped by a plane. As a result of this accident, strange radiation takes possession of the island and transforms the animals into monsters. The group is attacked by flesh eating snakes and giant wasps, but their worst enemy is a vicious werewolf. The movie is full of clichés. For example, Joe keeps tripping when he's running from the wolf, just like victims in slasher films always do. It was all meant to be stupid. The wolf was just a kid wearing a mask.
