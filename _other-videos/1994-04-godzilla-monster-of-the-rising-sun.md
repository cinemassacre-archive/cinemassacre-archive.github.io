  I had a 1 foot tall Godzilla figure, so I couldn't resist making a remake of the 1954 Japanese classic monster movie. I built a city, using old toys, complete with miniature toy cars for Godzilla to pick up in his mouth and plenty of buildings for him to knock over. For the final scene where Godzilla is blown to bits, I threw in a wooden model T-rex skeleton.
