  A friend of mine, Phil, was over my house, so I decided to have him act in a quick improvised movie. The plot involved a demonic mask that is found harboring the soul of an ancient warlock who died in the year 1693. Now, three centuries later, he possesses Phil's body once he wears the mask. Phil had to go home, so I cloned him with a hand-puppet and finished the movie all by myself. See also: 29. SNIX: THE RETURN, 37. SNIX AGAIN, 52. ROTTEN CORPSE OF SNIX, 53. POSSESSED MASK OF SNIX and 54. EVIL SPIRIT OF SNIX.
