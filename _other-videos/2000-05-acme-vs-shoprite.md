  For a highschool project, my friend had to make a television commercial. He decided to do a commercial for Acme and consulted me to help him make it. We ended up turning it into an action thriller where an Acme employee is fighting against a ShopRite employee. It turns into a car chase and climaxes with the Acme dude running over the Shoprite guy and crushing his head, which is actually a stuffed dummy with a watermelon head. Then he gets out of his car, faces the camera and says "Acme always crushes this competition." I heard that the class loved it, but the teacher said it was too violent.
