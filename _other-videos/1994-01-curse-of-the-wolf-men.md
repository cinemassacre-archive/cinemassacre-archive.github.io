  This marked the beginning of a new way to make movies without actors. I had no figures, toys or puppets that looked like The Wolf Man, so I just drew the whole story on paper in sequential panels like a comic book and videotaped them while playing music in the background and narrating the story. I also spoke the dialogue of all the characters, just like in all my puppet/figure films.
