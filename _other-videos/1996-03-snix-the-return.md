  I watched all of my old movies and my favorite was "Snix." To me, it was a classic, so as a joke, I decided to make its sequel after three years. I grew a lot in the past year and looked completely different, but still played the same role. I used the same mask from the original which was faded, crinkled and torn. As well as it being the return of Snix, it was also the return of me, making movies again like the old days.
