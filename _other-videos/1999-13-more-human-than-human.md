  I wanted to get a fake band together for a White Zombie music video, but we didn't have any instruments available, so the guitarist had to rock out on an acoustic guitar and the drummer just sat on a bed and slapped two dummy monster heads. It was real funny. The song on the CD played into my vcr which was connected to my camera, so the videotape recorded us on the video signal and the music simultaneously on the audio signal. The TV was turned on, blasting the music from its speaker, so we could perform to it and I could lip sync the vocals in my black top hat and long hair wig. After copying the best take onto another videotape, I inserted stock footage of old horror movies of mine to complete it.
