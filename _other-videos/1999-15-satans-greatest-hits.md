  This is a parody commercial advertising an album of 13 devil worshipping songs. A devil speaks and says "To order, call 1-800-666-HELL." Footage of various metal bands is used while the credit crawl lists all the songs including "AntiChrist Superstar" by Marilyn Manson, "Hell's Bells" by AC/DC, "Burn in Hell" by Judas Priest", "Number of the Beast" by Iron Maiden", "Selling my Soul" by Black Sabbath", "Unholy" by Kiss, and many more! This is first in a trilogy that has not yet been made. The next two are "Suicide's greatest hits" and "Junkie's greatest hits." Drugs, devil-worshipping, suicide... the stuff that makes rock n' roll great! (This is an example of my dark sick humor.)
