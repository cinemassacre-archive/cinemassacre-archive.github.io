  While taking some summer video production classes at the University of the Arts, I got to use some analog editing gear for my first time and edited a remake of one of my "Monster Music Videos" (filmography 96). This time, I was able to get the cuts just right and time it precisely with the music, the same way I envisioned it in my mind. It's chilling! This video is important to my career, because it marked the end of my amateurish in-camera editing method. Even though I had no editing gear of my own, two vcr's had to do.
