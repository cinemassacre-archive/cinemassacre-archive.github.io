  Ambitious but brainless production about child Ghostbusters who must combat evil spirits. Nice ideas and high energy, but overlong with barely any story structure. Production days were scattered over 6 months and I moved to a new neighborhood in the middle of it, so not only the locations change halfway through the movie, but so does the entire cast! The ghosts were created using a special trick of mine. Drawing them and superimposing them through the camera's title display function. It was weird.
