  Two undercover detectives team up to trace the source of a radioactive chemical that's been used by criminals to burn the faces of their victims. They eventually find a swimming pool full of the deadly stuff owned by Master Merciless. Thus begins a cheesy Kung Fu fight. After a series of disasters occurring such as my sister breaking her toe, this film was dropped.
