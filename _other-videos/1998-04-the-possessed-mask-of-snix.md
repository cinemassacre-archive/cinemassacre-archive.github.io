  The biggest problem in making the Snix series was the availability of the actors. The Rotten Corpse of Snix was a very simple movie but it took 10 months to make. Knowing I had two more chapters to go, I couldn't stand to take any longer, so this time, I casted no actors other than myself, so there was nothing to halt the production and it was over in two weeks. The plot picks up where Snix's body has been destroyed, but his mask still exists and haunts me. This movie provided me with great editing practice, and it's technically a better movie than the last Snix flicks, but it's not one of my favorites. It feels very solitary without any other actors to liven it up.
