  I took some Saturday animation classes at the University of the Arts and made a series of cut-out cartoons which featured people fleeing from dinosaurs, knights sword-fighting through castles and castaways exploring dangerous jungles. Though they're rushed and choppy-looking, they're fun to watch.
