  Shot in 1997, without any editing whatsoever. Whatever was shot on the VHS tape was the final movie. We didnâ€™t care. The music was dubbed directly onto the original master tape with an audio cassette recorder. The whole video was practically made during a walk home from the school bus.

  One day, my friend Brian was so bored, he picked a cluster of flowers off a tree and shoved the whole thing down his throat. Immediately, the idea for this movie came about. If he didn't mind eating those flowers, I was sure he wouldn't mind munching on some more. "The Herbivore" has no plot and no purpose, except to depict a peaceful day in the life of a human herbivore who dwells in the forest and eats weeds, leaves and flowers. A trilogy was planned, "The Carnivore" and "The Omnivore", but neither were filmed.
