  There's no band like Black Sabbath. Their cartoonishly dark music feeds me with vivid mental images which would make great music videos. I would make a video for every Sabbath song, if I had the time, but for a starter, I made one for the first song, the self-titled one on the first album. There is a loose narrative function to it, but it's mostly just a montage of supernatural images of horror. It resembles my older horror montage "The Feeling of Terror" (filmography 97) except that one used clips from existing films, while "Black Sabbath" uses only my own footage. I shot footage of a life-sized dummy burning in a fire, a close-up of a tarantula, a burning clay skull dripping red wax, and a grim reaper chasing somebody through a cemetery which is actually the same cemetery in Philadelphia which appeared in the movie "The Sixth Sense." This video contains some of the strongest imagery which I've ever produced and the editing is so tight, that you wouldn't believe I did it using two VCRs and no computers.
