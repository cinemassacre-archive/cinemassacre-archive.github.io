  This is a board game that's anything but boring!

  Fireball Island was released by Milton Bradley in 1986.  Instead of a flat board, players traverse a three-dimensional island in search of the idol Vul-Kar's jewel.  But escaping with the treasure won't be easy.

  Players utilize cards, bridges, caves, and tokens as they attempt to obtain the treasure.  Once they have it, they become the target of the other players.  And let's not forget the 5 - count 'em - 5 fireballs that can come careening down the mountain at any moment to engulf the players and put them in a smolder pit.  Then face the most harrowing challenge of them all - making your game piece fit on the boat!
