  It’s the season finale of Board James! For the moment, this is the last planned episode, just as DreamPhone was. Nothing is ever definitive. We will see what the future holds. For now, enjoy this epic conclusion to this year’s story arch.

  This time, we look at Nightmare, a VHS board game from the 90′s. It was part of the Atmosfear series, and was a very fun game to play with a group. It has always been the biggest request for Board James. But we go beyond Nightmare, into other games, and deeper into the Board James mythos.
