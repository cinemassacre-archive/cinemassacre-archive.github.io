  Sometimes, bigger isn't always better. James Rolfe and Mike Matei look in the board game closet and find one of the largest board games on the market: Battle Masters. Created by Milton Bradley, this strategic war game is one large behemoth. However, is this game simply too much for the two guys to handle? Well, there's only one way to know; by watching the video. Warning: couch moving and confusing rule explaining are all included in the package. Buckle your seatbelts.
