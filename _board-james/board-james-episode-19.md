current_description: |
  Board James loves board games enough to try one exclusively for girls: 1991â€²s "Electronic Dream Phone" by Milton Bradley.

  The plastic "phone" plays prerecorded clues about the game's stable of hunky guys. Players then use a process of elimination to determine their randomly assigned "secret admirer." First player to guess which guy likes them is declared the winner.

  Harmless slumber party fun? Or could James and his pals be in for a longer night than they were expecting?
