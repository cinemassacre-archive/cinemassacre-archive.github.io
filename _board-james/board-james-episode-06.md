  This episode features quite a treat, arguably the most brutal and unforgiving board game ever created, brought to us by the childhood mind of Board James himself.

  Deadly Danger Dungeon!!!

  But first, we're treated to a smattering of other self-created games from James' childhood.  We go to space, cause mayhem in a neighborhood, steal jewelry, and even get a glimpse at the ORIGINAL Street Fighter 3!

  Mike returns to take the role of a treasure-seeker who falls into a dungeon full of spikes, rocks, and nasty traps.  Every step he takes could mean certain death, and only the luck of the dice will keep him alive!  

  Can Mike survive long enough to collect a key, a magic talisman, and escape to tell the tale?
