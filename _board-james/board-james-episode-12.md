  In this disastrous episode, Board James takes a look at Donut Disaster. 

  In 1992, the Parker Brothers introduced Donut Disaster. Designed by Jim Keifer, the goal was for each player to place their donuts on the baking machine. The first player to get rid of their donuts wins! Each player is assigned a set of donuts of each color. The dice has colors on each side. Once rolled, the player places on the baking machine their donut which has the corresponding color on the dice, after which they pass the dice onto the next player. After some time, the machine goes haywire and throws all of the donuts into the air. The player who was rolling on that turn will need to catch the donuts, otherwise they will be assigned all of the donuts that they didn't catch.

  James and Mike play this noisy game to bake their donuts - until the aroma of the donuts attracts an unwanted guest. Watch what happens when you mix Bad Luck and Disaster!
