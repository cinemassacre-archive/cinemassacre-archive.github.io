current_description: |
  When Board James is bored, he plays some board games.  In the inaugural episode, James takes a look at a childhood classic - Mouse Trap.  

  In 1963, the Ideal Toy Company introduced this little gem to the world.  Inspired by the work of cartoonist and inventor Rube Goldberg, the goal was to slowly build a wacky, overly complicated trap for opponents' mouse.  The rules have changed, but the concept has stayed the same, because there's no sense in fixing something that's not broken.

  Board James walks us through the game's instructions, although there's really not much point.  The journey from Start to Finish is nothing more than luck of the dice.  The highlight of the game is setting up the trap, and then watching the Looney Tunes-esque contraption work its magic.  If you've never seen it, you never had a childhood.
