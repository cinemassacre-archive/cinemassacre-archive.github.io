mikes_notes:
  For this episode, James had me pick from a stack of NES games and choose which one I wanted him to review. I picked Who Framed Roger Rabbit (NES) because I played it a lot when I was a kid. James and I sat next to each other and recorded the footage on a small LCD screen. This was before we really had a good method for recording the game footage. James remembered how funny it was to punch people with Eddie. And I showed him some of the tricks in the game. Like how to get to the secret building, and getting to Toontown.

  Up until this point, these reviews were only available to watch as Quicktime files on the old version of the Cinemassacre website. And around this time, I had just heard about a new website that was getting popular called Youtube. It offered people an easier way to watch videos than having to download a large Quicktime file. So I quickly made a Youtube account called “JamesNintendoNerd” and uploaded the first four videos. (Unfortunately, I did not put much thought into the channel name and they don’t allow you to change it!)

  Also, I made a Myspace page for the videos to help get them seen. That was very helpful in the early days to promote the videos. It’s funny now looking back. A world where myspace was popular and YouTube was new. Now that’s taking you back to the past.

  The Nerd wonders if someone framed him to tackle a bad video game, as he takes on the NES game based on Who Framed Roger Rabbit. This is Angry Video Game Nerd episode 4.

  Who Framed Roger Rabbit was an amazing film and captured the imaginations of children and adults alike. Released in June 1988 it was a box office smash. The level of integration with live action actors and hand drawn animated characters had not been seen on this scale before. Directed by Robert Zemekis and starring Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd, and Kathleen Turner as Rogers busty wife Jessica Rabbit.

  In this episode the Nerd takes a look at the video game adaptation of the movie for the NES. It was released in 1989 and, as is the fate of many movie adaptations ,it was an utter disappointed to many children. The game goes out of its way to make things difficult and cryptic, great for us 5 year olds at the time eh? From its notoriously bad controls and ridiculous driving stages lets watch as the Nerd sets his sights on yet another game on the list of games ruined by the dreaded rainbow: LJN Toys Inc.
