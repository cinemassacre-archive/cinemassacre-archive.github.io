Here's the Angry Video Game Nerd episode 100! Had to reupload to the second channel. Nintendo's Robotic Operating Buddy or, R.O.B for short, was an attempt to increase sales following the video game crash of 1983. ROB was released in Japan in 1985 and saw an American release later the same year. 

Originally planned to be the start of a Robot Series, there were only 2 games ever released, Gyromite and Stack Up. Both of the these games requires R.O.B. to play and prove to be more frustrating than fun.  It was a bold move that paid off for Nintendo and paved the way for their tradition of making the player more interactive.

In this episode, the Nerd reviews both Gyromite and Stack Up, exploring the pitfalls of both of these original launch titles. He goes over both the functionality and dysfunction of R.O.B which culminates in the most epic battles of Godzilla-like proportions.
