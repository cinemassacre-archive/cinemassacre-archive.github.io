In this episode, the Nerd picks up his sword and shield to go on an adventure into Hyrule. We'll see the Nerd give his honest opinion on Zelda 2. 

Originally released in Japan in 1987 on the Family Computer Disk System and 1988 on the Nintendo Entertainment System in both America and Europe, Zelda 2: The Adventure of Link was the first and only official side scrolling Zelda game in the series. Going on to become known as one of the worst, if not the worst Zelda games amongst fans due to its radical change and difficulty from the previous Zelda game. Zelda 2 was one of the first most highly anticipated games back in the NES days, along with the likes of Super Mario Bros 3. 

This is Angry Video Game Nerd episode 93.
