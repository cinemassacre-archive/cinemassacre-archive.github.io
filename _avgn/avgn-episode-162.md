The Angry Video Game Nerd reviews the Amiga CD32 console. Watch as the Nerd dives head first into some of the worst video games ever. The Amiga CD32 had such "gems" as Gloom, Kang Fu, Oscar, Naughty Ones, Morph, Beavers, Zool, Dangerous Streets, and of course Surf Ninjas for some reason. This is Angry Videogame Nerd episode 162.
