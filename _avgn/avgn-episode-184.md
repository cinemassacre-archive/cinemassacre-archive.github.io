Angry Video Game Nerd (AVGN) episode 184: Countdown Vampires for the PlayStation 1. Countdown Vampires is a survival horror game developed by K2 LLC and published by Bandai. It's basically Resident Evil, but with vampires instead of zombies. In Countdown Vampires, you play Keith Snyder, a tattooed celebrity bodyguard who has come to the ritzy Desert Moon Hotel on New Year's Eve 1999. When a fire starts in the hotel, the ceiling sprinklers go off. Rather than spray water, they drop an oozing dark liquid all over the glamorous guests. This liquid, whatever it is, turns the other guests into vampires. Now it's your job to find an antidote while fending off preying bloodsuckers, flesh-eating zombies, and bone-crushing monsters. Through the game you'll explore eight different locations--from woodland areas to bars to casino floors--to solve the mystery. It also happens to be one of the worst tank-controlled PS1 games of all time.
