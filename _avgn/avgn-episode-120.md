This review is from the feature-length film "Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie" now adapted into "episode" format. You can view this as a plot spoiler, but I'm sure everyone already knows the movie ends with an E.T. review. The movie is more about the story behind the game, the Atari landfill, but with a science fiction twist. To understand all the context and imagination behind it, see the movie. Or enjoy it here as a standard "Nerd" episode. 

This is AVGN Episode 120.
