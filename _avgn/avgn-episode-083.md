<p class="yt-description">YouTube description:</p>

Little red (riding?) hood was a unlicensed NES game released for Nintend 8-bit systems. Needless to say, it sucked like almost every Unlicensed game known (remember Wisdom tree games?).

The game is (barely) based on the famous fairy tale. You know, that fairy tale where little RED HOOD spent her time kicking trees, searching for hidden dogs under rocks, dodging giant deformed bears and shooting people with a slingshot.

The game cartdidge is today a rare item in the markets and it's sold for hundreds of dollars... Shocking, isn't?
