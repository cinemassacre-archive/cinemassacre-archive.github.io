Halloween is upon him, so for his nightmarish night the Nerd must review three very bad Halloween-themed video games for the Atari 2600. This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 36.

John Carpenter's Halloween is well regarded as one of the most influential horror movies of all time.  Released in 1978, the film unknowingly launched the career of scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis and arguably created it's own genre: the slasher.

The film's success also led to something much more evil...Halloween, the video game.

Released by Wizard Video for the Atari 2600, the game featured horrifying acts of violence, all in glorious 8-bit graphics.  Unfortunately, the game wasn't able to live up to the film's success.   

On this particular Halloween night, the Nerd must survive horrible games, the Shape himself, and possibly the worst horror of all...CHILDREN!  All On The Night He Came Home!
