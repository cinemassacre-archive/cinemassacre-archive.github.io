Angry Video Game Nerd (AVGN) episode 180: The Incredible Crash Dummies... or "Crash Test Dummies" if you prefer (not the 90s band). The game was published by LJN (on the NES) and was based on the cartoon, based on the public service announcements, based on the actual real-world crash test  dummies that are used in car safety tests. This NES game was released in 1993 when the next gen systems were already in full swing. This game is for other systems too, like the SNES and Genesis, but The Nerd wanted to focus on the original Nintendo game by his least favorite game publisher.
