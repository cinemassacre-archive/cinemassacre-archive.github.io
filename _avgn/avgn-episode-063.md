Michael Jackson. The King of Pop. The figure behind the highest selling album of all time. The man who made countless hit after hit song. And, as the Nerd discovers, the star of his own Sega Genesis game!

Follow everyone's foul-mouthed Nerd as he delves into a relic of the 80's, Michael Jackson's Moonwalker. Things only get more and more crazy as he has to deal with rescuing kids under fishy circumstances, unstoppable hordes of zombies, and M.J. grabbing his...err... naughty bits. And that's not even including the dancing dogs, Bubbles the Monkey, and bizarre music omissions!

But no one could have seen coming what happens when everyone's favorite Smooth Criminal takes a ride on a shooting star...

This is Angry Videogame Nerd episode 63
