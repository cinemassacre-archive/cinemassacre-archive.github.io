Published by Vic Tokai in 1990, Kid Kool and the Quest for the Seven Wonder Herbs seems like a good-enough 2D platformer on the surface. First, there's a day-night cycling feature without the annoying Castlevania 2-like text announcing the transition; and the time limit heavily dictates one of the game's several possible endings, which forces you to keep on your toes. 

This is Angry Videogame Nerd episode 103.
