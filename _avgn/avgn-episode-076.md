One of the worst sequels this side of "Highlander 2," Super Pitfall took the protagonist of the hit Atari 2600 game and stranded him in an intractable labyrinth of madness. Buggy graphics, glitches, invisible items, and ladders to nowhere are just some of the agonies awaiting the Nerd as he examines what went wrong when Pitfall Harry graduated to the NES platform. This is Angry Videogame Nerd episode 76.
