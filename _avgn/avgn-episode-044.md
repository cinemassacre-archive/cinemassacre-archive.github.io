In this part one of two special, the Nerd looks at the Intellivision and the games made for it, including Utopia, Masters of the Universe: The Power of He-Man and Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, and also takes a look at two games designed for the Intellivoice Voice Synthesis Module.This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 44.

In part one of this two part review the Nerd takes a look way back to the 1980's. With the introduction of the Atari 2600 in 1977 and its success, other companies decided to throw down with Atari and try to capitalize on this new market. This first of these efforts was the Intellvison by Mattel Electronics. The Intellivision was test marketed in 1979 and officially released in the US in 1980. The system sold over 3 million units and had a library of over 125 games.  In 1982, there was even the Intellivoice adapter that put speech in the game (B-17 BOOOOOOMBER) and also the introduction of the Intellivison II which had detachable controllors and a more sleek design and even the ability to play Atari games with the Intellivision console (WHAT?).

Unfortunately, with the video game crash of 1983 and a saturated market of competition Mattel Electronics closed its doors for good, taking substantial financial loss. In 2009 the Intellivision was named the 14th greatest video game console by IGN.com. Join us in part two when we take a look back to the Colecovision.
