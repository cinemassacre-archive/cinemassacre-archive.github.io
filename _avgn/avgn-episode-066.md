The Atari Jaguar is host to a lineup of games that range wildly in quality. Some games are well-constructed and can be enjoyable, such as Alien vs. Predator and Tempest 2000. However, a majority of them do not fall into this category, and we are "treated" to the likes of a Mortal Kombat knockoff known as "Kisumi Ninja" and a game lacking any semblance of logic known as "Mutant Penguins." Terrible games like these helped contribute to the extinction of Atari's mighty 64-bit feline.

So how will the Nerd fair against this barrage of bad games? Will he be able to survive with his sanity intact? Or will he succumb to the madness? And will he learn how to fly? Watch and find out now!
