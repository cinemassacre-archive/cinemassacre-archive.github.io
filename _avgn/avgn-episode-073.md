In this episode, James takes a look at yet another Mario game in the Nintendo mega franchise. The game "Mario is Missing!" was originally released on PC, Mac, NES and SNES, but at different times. It came out in 1992 for the PC and SNES, both developed by Mindscape. However, the version that James is playing is the NES version, published by Nintendo, released in 1993. It's also the first game to feature Luigi as the main character, which wouldn't occur again until 2001's "Luigi's Mansion", and for a good reason.

This is Angry Videogame Nerd episode 73.
