The Nerd boldly goes where no bad game should ever go, by beaming down a collection of games based upon the sci-fi series Star Trek, made for the Vectrex, Atari 2600, ColecoVision and NES. This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 49. 

Star Trek is one of the biggest phenomenons in the history of pop culture. The original television series was created by Gene Roddenberry and aired for 3 seasons from 1966-1969. It has been spun off into several different series such as Star Trek: TNG and Voyager to name just a few as well as a whole movie franchise and reboots by J.J. Abrams. The show launched the careers of many actors such as William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, and Patrick Stewart just to name a few.

With the mass production of collectibles and toys and the advent of arcades and home systems, Star Trek found its way to the world of video games. In this episode the Nerd boldly goes where no nerd has gone before, and takes a look at  Star Trek games for Vectrex, Atari 2600, and the Colecovision, which are all basically the same.

Lastly the Nerd reviews the NES Star Trek 25th Anniversary game. The game was originally released in 1992 by Ultra Games and has surprisingly good cut-scenes for its time. That being said its still frustrating, confusing, and cryptic. We also learn not to mess with Klingons. They don't mess around.
