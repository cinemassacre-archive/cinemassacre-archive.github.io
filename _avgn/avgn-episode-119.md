In this episode the Nerd takes a look at Desert Bus and Castlevania II: Simon's Quest Redaction! Desert Bus was a mini game that was included on Penn & Teller's Smoke and Mirrors (and unreleased game planned for the Sega CD). It was developed by Imagineering and published by Absolute Entertainment. Absolute went out of business so the game was never released but the Nerd was able to obtain a copy to torture himself with! In Desert Bus, you drive a bus from Arizona to Las Vegas in real time. It's considered one of the worst games ever made, making it ripe for a review by the Nerd!

Then the Nerd takes a look at Castlevania II: Simon's Quest Redacted - a hack that improves upon the flaws in the original NES game.

This is Angry Videogame Nerd episode 119.
