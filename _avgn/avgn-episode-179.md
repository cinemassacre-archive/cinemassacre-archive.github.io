Angry Video Game Nerd (AVGN) episode 179: Dennis the Menace. Hey! Mr. Wilson!! Here's the Nerd playing the 1993 Super Nintendo game Dennis the Menace. It's a licensed game based on the movie, which is based on the old show and comic from the 50s and 60s. The game was designed by Ocean, which is basically the British LJN. The Nerd hasn't done a full review episode on an SNES game in a while, so, here you go!!
