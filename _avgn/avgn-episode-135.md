The Angry Video Game Nerd reviews Darkwing Duck for the Turbografx 16. This is the first time the Nerd has done an ENTIRE EPISODE dedicated to a game for the TG16 (the original card-based console). However, he has briefly talked about the Turbo Grafx 16 CD game Fighting Street for the CD-based console, as part of the Street Fighter 2010 review. 

This is Angry Videogame Nerd episode 135.
