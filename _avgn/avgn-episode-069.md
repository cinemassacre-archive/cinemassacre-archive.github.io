Today Our favorite Nerd will go up against the X-Men video games for the NES and Sega Genesis. The NES games (the Uncanny X-Men and Wolverine) are unfortunately published by LJN, complete with horrible graphics, bad hit detection, unrecognizable enemies, frustrating level designs, and health going away faster than you can say "Welcome to Die!" However, the Sega Genesis (X-Men and X-Men 2: Clone Wars games) are far superior, so the details and flaws on those games are best explained in the episode itself. Also, keep an eye out on how Wolverine's claws evolved from not available to permanently playable.

Note: Ever since the episode's release, the X-Men arcade game has since got ported to Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network.

This is Angry Videogame Nerd episode 69
