Japan's legendary giant monster can't avoid being put into a number of video games, as the Nerd takes a look at a selection of bad ones based upon Godzilla for the NES, Game Boy, SNES and Super Famicom – such as Godzilla: Monster of Monsters and Godzilla 2: War of the Monsters – and a trio of good ones for the Xbox and the PlayStation 2.

This is Angry Videogame Nerd episode 77.
