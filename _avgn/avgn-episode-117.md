Welcome back to the Angry Video Game Nerd's second part of his Christmas-themed wishlist, going back to reviewing terrible games hoping in vain he may find a good one - just maybe. In this 2/2 episode, the Nerd jumps straight in, starting with the first review at A Boy and His Blob (NES), and continuing along with (in chronological order): The Three Stooges (NES); Home Improvement (SNES); Pit Fighter (SNES); Bubsy 3-D (PlayStation); and Spider-Man: Maximum Carnage (SNES). 

This is Angry Videogame Nerd episode 117.
