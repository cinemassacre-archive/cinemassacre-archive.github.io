The AVGN pulls out and reviews as many video game magazines as he can find, except for Nintendo Power. From Atari Age, to GamePro, to some lesser known gaming magazines, the 80s and 90s were filled with great reads. The walkthroughs, reviews, previews, ratings... and the terrible ads. This is episode 166 of the Angry Video Game Nerd season 13.
