The Cheetahmen is a video game series created by Active Enterprises featuring three anthropomorphic cheetahs. It was introduced in 1991, as part of the Action 52 multi-game cartridge for the NES. Full of glitches and broken levels, Cheetahmen was sure to make you ask, why am I playing this game? This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 91.
