James Rolfe has produced hundreds of hours of film and video since childhood, including over 100 video game reviews. With so much experience in quick-turnaround video, he understandably gets many questions about his equipment, technique and creative philosophy.

Join James "behind the curtain" as he writes, produces, performs and edits a special mini-episode of AVGN, taking the viewer along for a revealing and entertaining look inside a Cinemassacre production. This is Angry Videogame Nerd episode 102.
