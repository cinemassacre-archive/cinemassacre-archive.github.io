<p class="mikes-notes">Mike's notes:</p>

– For episode 14 the Nerd reviews The Power Glove!

– I believe the Power Glove, the sensors for the TV and most of the stack of games were mine. I remember telling James about how the sensors worked. (Not well! Thats how they worked!)

– Around this time I gave James a large amount of my gaming stuff to use in the videos. Such as the Atari 5200 which appears a few episodes later. This was before fans began donating games. (Thanks by the way!)
