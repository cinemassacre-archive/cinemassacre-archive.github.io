Angry Video Game Nerd (AVGN) episode 177: Mortal Kombat 1 Ports.  Mortal Kombat is the ultimate arcade fighting game, developed by Midway in 1992. Acclaim released four official ports in North America as part of the "Mortal Monday" campaign a year later. There were for the Super NES (SNES), Sega Genesis, Game Boy, and Game Gear systems. Mortal Kombat 1 became a best-selling game and remains one of the most popular fighting games in the genre's history. The Nerd reviews and compares each of these ports and weighs in on what made "Mortal Monday" so important.
