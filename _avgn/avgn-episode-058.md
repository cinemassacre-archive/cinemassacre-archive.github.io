<p class="yt-description">YouTube description:</p>

Halloween has arrived, and the Nerd is green with anger at finding out that there are bad video games on the NES and SNES that have been based on another horror legend â€“ Frankenstein. With the aid of a very special-guest reviewer to share in the misery, The Nerd has dug-up three not-so-classics from the 8 and 16 bit era which are clunkier then the main protagonist they feature. He'll be going green with re-appearing bosses, knock-off Street-Fighter moves and infuriating password screens. Enough to make anyone wish theyd never been born (again).

He'll also discover that the monster he's created isn't just sat with him on the couch but embedded deep within his soul, forcing him to carry on torturing himself with terrible games until it destroys him. He should really have listened to Doctor Waldman.....

This is Angry Videogame Nerd episode 58.
