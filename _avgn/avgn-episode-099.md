In this episode, the Nerd reviews a handful of Star Wars games. There have been many incarnations of the original trilogy and in this episode the Nerd reviews the different variations from the  Atari 2600 attempt to recreate the arcade experience, to the Famicom game only released in Japan (for good reason).

The NES and SNES also had their own versions in the 90s that are featured and are surprising improvements over the others. That being said they are still equally as frustrating. The Nerd also reviews  Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back on NES, as well as the far superior (but way harder) "Super Trilogy" on SNES published by JVC and THQ. With special appearance of the Beer Droid.
