When the Nerd finds a copy of Nintendo Power exuding a belief that EarthBound was a rotten game, he later finds reviews that show how glamorous the game was and reveals a fanbase for a title he now has to play. So he does – via the Super NES Classic Edition – and provides an insight about the game's various flaws but well-thought out gameplay. This is Angry Videogame Nerd episode 156.
