This time around the Nerd tackles the many incarnations of the Terminator sequel from the console ports of the T2: Arcade game to the NES and SNES versions based off the movie. With the successful second installment surely the games based off this couldn't be as bad right? Well maybe if the dreaded rainbow (LJN)  wasn't the primary publisher we made have had a chance.

This is Angry Videogame Nerd episode 71.
