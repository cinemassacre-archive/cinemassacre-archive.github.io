  – For episode 8 the Nerd reviews Wally Bear and the NO! Gang (NES)

  – Other than Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, so far most of the games reviewed were well known. Now we started to delve into the more obscure NES titles.

  – Later on for the AVGN Volume 1 DVD release a new scene was added where the Nerd calls the Wally Bear hotline!

  The Nerd finds out what is bad about Wally Bear and the NO! Gang for the NES, a game aimed at teaching kids to not take drugs. This is Angry Video Game Nerd episode 8. 

  Release in 1992, Wally Bear and the NO! Gang was inspired by Nancy Reagan's 'Just say No!' campaign.  Originally, the full titled was 'Wally Bear and the Just Say No Gang', but was shorten due to the 'Just Say No' phrase was already trademarked.

  As with other unlicensed NES titles (Tengen, Wisdom Tree), Wally Bear came in a obscure black cartridge that differed from other NES carts.  

  In this game, you star as Wally Bear, who must travel through levels while avoiding obstacles and Ricky the Rat.  During these stages, you come across with situations from convincing friends not to do drugs or join a gang.

  This is an edutainment game that was meant to keep kids away from drugs and gangs, but with AVGN involved, he encourage you to say no to drugs and NO to games like this!

  Note: The toll free number hotline: 1-800-HI-WALLY was still active during AVGN's review, but was disconnected in Oct. 2007.
