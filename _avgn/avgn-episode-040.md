  The Nerd tries to make sense of the chronology behind the timeline for one of Nintendo's well-known video game series â€“ The Legend of Zelda. This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 40.

  NOTE: After this video was released, Nintendo released the official Zelda timeline. The point of this video is, when we were kids, when the NES and SNES were out, nobody thought much about a timeline. It wasn't until later (after Ocarina of Time) when all the timeline theories really started. The Legend of Zelda is exactly what the title says - it's a LEGEND. A Legend is an unverified story handed down from earlier times. Often changed as time goes by, because different people remember the story in a different way.
  
  Nintendo releasing a timeline is a reaction to the fan outcry that there needed to be one. When originally, no such thing was ever even considered. The point of the Zelda games is to explore and figure out puzzles. The timeline stuff is unimportant.
