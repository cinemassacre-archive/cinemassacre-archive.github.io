The Nerd finds out what it's like to play the Virtual Boy, by trying out some games on it. This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 42.

Keep your eye doctor on speed-dial, because this time, the Nerd's tackling the Virtual Boy! Released in July of 1995 by Nintendo, this "portable" console was touted as being able to display "true 3D graphics" and deliver a truly unique gaming experience.

Indeed, the experience was unique, but primarily because the games were projected in bright red directly into gamer's retinas. Did I mention that a side-effect of the Virtual Boy was potential eye-bleeding? The sheer weight of the device and lack of any sort of head-strap also prevented it from being remotely portable. Truly a shame, given how fashionable this massive red pair of binoculars on a tripod is.

So what kind of gaming catalog can be expected of such a "unique" contraption? You'll be hard-pressed to tell all 12 of them apart, because no matter which game you choose, all you'll be seeing is red. Good thing the Nerd's got glasses, or else he'd really be screwed!
