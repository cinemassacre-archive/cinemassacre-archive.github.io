As the Nerd prepares to review Battletoads for the NES, he finds himself joined by the "guitar guy" who's been living behind his couch, and who helps to show him why it's impossible to complete the game with two players. This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 55.

Battletoads is one of the gems that Konami put out on the NES. Konami witnessed the success of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and created a franchise to mirror. The Battletoads franchise also sported action figures and an animated series, which never lived up to the hype of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The NES game debuted in 1991 and its' notoriety stemmed from it's obvious similarity to the Teenage Mutant Nina Turtles and its' incredibly difficult gameplay. The game is also playable on the Sega Genesis and had a sequel/crossover game with Double Dragon. 

The game possesses extremely fluid gameplay and original music and sound effects that perfectly suit its' "beat em up style." The game included a variety level designs that go back and forth between beat em up, platform, and racing. All of which (beyond the second level) are infamously difficult. The Nerd reviews this game and demonstrates it's impeccably cooperative two-player mode with his very recognizable theme song artist. The pair show us how a two-player beat em up game should be programmed as they pay homage to one of the most underrated classics from the NES library.
