Life of Black Tiger: Angry Video Game Nerd episode 170. The AVGN is playing the most modern game he's ever played before on the PlayStation 4. But, of course it might be one of the worst games he's ever played. Life of Black Tiger is a mobile game ported to the PS4 where you play as an emo tiger fighting the wild and humanity to save his cute baby. Gilbert Gottfried guest stars as a certain game designer that's never been seen on the show before.
