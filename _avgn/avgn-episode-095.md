For Halloween this year, the Nerd decides to give a much longer and more in-depth review of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde for the NES. In 1988, an infamous videogame was developed by the Advance Communication Company, published by Toho and Bandai and released for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Loosely based off the famous novel by Robert Louis Stevenson, the result was a slow-paced side-scroller with obnoxious enemies, useless weapons, unclear instructions and deaths that came at random; an unholy abomination that would have better banished into obscurity. 

This is Angry Videogame Nerd episode 95.
