A 3rd person action video game that revolves around a little kid that falls asleep in class and dreams up wild adventures. Events in class trigger his dreams. Such as a bully stealing his pencil, which turns into a quest to look for a lance in medieval times. Watch as the Nerd talks about this mediocre piece of junk.
