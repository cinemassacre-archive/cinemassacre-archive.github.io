In Part two of two, The Nerd takes a look at Shaq Fu for the SNES, and three bad games for the Wii.This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 39.

The Nerd's knee-jerk misanthropy has come back to haunt him, as three ghosts (each strangely familiar in their own way) have come to show him the terrible track his life is on.
 
A dazzling tour of the Nerd's past, present and future puts his life into sharp perspective, while examining which is worse: "Shaq Fu" or yet another trite "Christmas Carol" retread. After all, it's not like the Nerd could ever be redeemed... or could he?
