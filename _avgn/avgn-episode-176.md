Angry Video Game Nerd (AVGN) episode 176: Raid 2020. 11 years ago the Nerd said he might review Raid 2020 in the year 2020, and now that time has come. Raid 2020 is a cyberpunk action game developed and published by Color Dreams AKA Wisdom Tree for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). It was released in 1989. The object is to defeat all the drug dealers, defeat the drug lord Pit Bull, and eradicate drugs from the streets of America. As agent Shadow, the player faces a dystopian future world where moral collapse is inevitable. He is described as representing the last uncorrupted vestiges of law enforcement.
