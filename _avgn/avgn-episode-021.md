<p class="mikes-notes">Mike's notes:</p>

– For episode 21 AVGN reviews Ghostbusters on the Nintendo Entertainment System.

– James and I talked about this game for hours and hours on end. In particular, the speaking part on the title screen that says “GHOSTBUSTERS!” in a muffled voice. We sat around mocking that voice for hours.

– I did the drawing of the kids rocketing through the roof at James request.

f there's something bad, and you don't like it, then you need the Nerd. He's soon tackling something worse than ghosts, when he reviews Ghostbusters for the NES. This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 21.

Ghostbusters was one the one most popular and innovative movies of the eighties and a huge part of several generations childhoods. It starred Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Harold Ramis Ernie Hudson and Rick Moranis. The movie was a leap ahead in special effects in its day, and a legitimate phenomenon.

It was only a natural evolution that this franchise would translate to other mediums and with the video game boom of the eighties of course there had to be games made. What a great idea, we thought. 

The game was published by Activision and released in 1986, a full 2 years after the movie. A game that had plenty of time to learn from the mistakes of the previous versions on Atari and Commodore 64, but instead chose to just port the same horrible game.

What's scarier than ghosts, ghouls and dodging drunk drivers? Stairs In this part one of a three part series, the Nerd reviews the 8-bit incarnation on Nintendo of the original Ghostbusters. We learn how NOT to make a movie adaptation and the heartbreak and anger from childhood that still resides in the Nerds heart. Also ghost vacuums.
