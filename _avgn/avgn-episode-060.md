In part two of the Nerd's CD-I series he plays through Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon: one of the three Zelda games released on the system. After failed plans with Nintendo, Phillips had permission to use Zelda characters for the CD-I; however Nintendo had no input in the games development besides some character designs.

The game is a side-scroller in similar style to Zelda 2, but you play as Zelda instead of Link. Its frustrating controls, confusing layouts and bizarre animated cut-scenes have led to it being universally panned by critics and gamers alike.

This is Angry Videogame Nerd episode 60.
