For the 2010 Christmas special of The Angry Video Game Nerd, we have a parody of the classic Grinch story. The reviews here are all done in rhyme, like a children's story. With illustrations by Mike Matei (title card artist for AVGN). 

The music was done by Bear McCreary. You can see a behind the scene's video about the making of the music here. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GROAs.... Games reviewed (in rhyme) include: T&C Surf Designs, Circus Caper and Fist of the Northstar.
