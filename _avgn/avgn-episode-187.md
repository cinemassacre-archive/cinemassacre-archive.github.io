Angry Video Game Nerd (AVGN) episode 187: The Simpsons: Bartman Meets Radioactive Man. The Nerd reviewed the first two Simpsons NES games 13 years ago. Now he's back to review the third awful Simpsons NES game: Bartman Meets Radioactive Man! This "game" published by Acclaim (LJN in disguise) is the side-scrolling platformer that features Bart Simpson on a comic book quest to rescue his kidnapped idol, superhero Radioactive Man. It's a weird mix of the show and the whole Bartman concept (later used in real-world comics.) This is also this year's Christmas episode, so Happy Holidays to all, we'll see you next year!
