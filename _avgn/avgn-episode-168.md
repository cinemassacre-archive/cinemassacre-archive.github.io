Pepsiman!! Episode 168 of the Angry Video Game Nerd pits the AVGN vs. Pepsiman, the Japanese PlayStation classic. There was so many junk food video games in the 1990's. From MC Kids, to the Burger King Games, to Chester Cheetah. But what about the Pepsi superhero from Japan... Pepsiman?? Well. He's clumsy and useless, just like the game. Enjoy this Pepsiman review... with a Coke.
