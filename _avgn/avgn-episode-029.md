To protect the independence of good games from bad ones, the Nerd takes on the PlayStation game based upon Independence Day, and is soon wishing aliens could destroy this one. This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 29.

This is the first time the Nerd reviews a PC game, and it's based off the 1996 film Independence Day starring Will Smith. The game was made by Radical Entertainment and released for Sony Playstation, PC, Sega Saturn in 1997. It's a 3-D shooting game that the nerd decides is mediocre.
