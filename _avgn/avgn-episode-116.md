Welcome to the Angry Video Game Nerd's first part of his beloved Christmas wishlist, in which he briefly reviews several games, ranging from the classic Nintendo Entertainment System up to the Sony PlayStation, which are all the games the Nerd wishes he could review, but maybe not dedicate a whole episode towards that individual game. In this first part, the Nerd's video game wishlist is (in chronological order): Skate or Die (NES); Bad Dudes (NES); Karate Champ (NES); Sonic Blast (SEGA GameGear); Sonic Labrynth (SEGA GameGear); Sonic R (SEGA Saturn); Sonic Shuffle (SEGA DreamCast); Shadow the Hedgehog (GameCube); and Where's Waldo? (NES). 

This is Angry Videogame Nerd episode 116.
