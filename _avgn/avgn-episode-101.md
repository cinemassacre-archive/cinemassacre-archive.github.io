Perhaps the world's greatest maker of "fun" movies, Steven Spielberg grew to phenomenal popularity on a similar timeline with video games. That games would be created celebrating his science fiction and fantasy blockbusters is absolutely unavoidable.

Of course, a beloved movie in no way guarantees a quality video game tie-in, and Spielberg's career stands as one of the great lessons in the perils of overeager licensing.

Join the Nerd as he wallows through a collection of the worst Spielberg-based games ever created in his 101st video game review.

This is Angry Videogame Nerd episode 101.
