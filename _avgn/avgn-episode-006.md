  – For Episode 6 the Nerd takes a look at the Back to the Future (NES) as well as BTTF 2 & 3 (NES).

  – A clip from this episode appeared on a Viral Video special on MTV in September 2006.

  – I remember Kevin Finn who played the Glitch Gremlin was around when James recorded this episode. We had a funny conversation about the game. You know how Marty just walks down the street in the game? What does that have to do with Back to the Future right? Well, I said “They might as well call the game Joe goes down the road”. Because really, walking down the street has nothing to do with back to the future, but that’s basically all that happens.

  The Nerd certainly travels back in time, as he takes a look at two bad NES games based on the Back to the Future series. This is Angry Video Game Nerd episode 6. 

  AVGN didn't want to review this game, but it seems Darth Vader from the Planet Vulcan threaten him to melt his brain if he didn't.

  'Back to the Future', released in theaters Jul. 3, 1985, star Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly, who accidentally traveled back in time after running away from Libyan Terrorists who hunted down Doc Brown, played by Christopher Lloyd, for stealing their plutonium (the time travel resource needed to power the 1.21 gigawatts for the flux capacitor).  Thus, with other problems including intervening with his parents and the quintessential bully, Biff Tannen, he has to find a way to get 'Back to the Future'!

  With a classic movie franchise like this, what can possibly go wrong?  Released four years later on Sept. 1989, it was released under AVGN's dreaded brand:  LJN!

  AVGN complained about how it didn't follow the movie where Marty McFly have to collect clocks while using a bowling ball to fight off bullies, hula-hoop girls, killer bees, and guys holding a sheet of glass.  Although the skateboard is featured in this game and necessary to advance, it's hard to maneuver without crashing into anything.  

  AVGN also complained about the repetitive music that plays throughout the game (until the bonus stages).  

  (Later revealed as a speed up guitar riff version of Huey Lewis' 'Power of Love', the main theme of Back to the Future.)

  Check out the revelation here:

  Adding more insults to AVGN, a sequel was released Sept. 1990 (Also released under LJN!)

  After trying to review this sequel, mainly a nonsense version of Super Mario Bros., the only positive comment he can make is that it fits inside a toaster.

  Eventually, AVGN revisited the 'Back to the Future' games.  For the 'Back to the Future Revisited' review, click here:

  Note:  Two of his famous nerd rants, 'Buffalo Diarrhea and Roadkill Skunk', eventually made it to his 'AVGN theme song'.
