<p class="yt-description">YouTube description:</p>

The Magnavox Odyssey was offered for sale in 1972, pre-packed with a collection of "cartridges" that were little more than primitive circuit boards and colorful screen overlays so you could see what you were supposed to be playing. This dinosaur is almost unrecognizable as a video game, but is still a critical milestone in gaming. Both as the first home console, and because one of its games is the very first video tennis game, pre-dating Atari's 'Pong' by several months.
 
In this video, the Nerd explores one of the remaining pristine-condition Odysseys, with his irritation tempered by respect for history. The game still sucks, though.
