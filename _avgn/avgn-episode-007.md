  – In episode 7 the Nerd makes fun of the McKids NES game.

  – This is the first episode where the theme song by Kyle Justin appears before the review.

  – James and I recently did [a panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poH8ewqO_ow) where we talked about the McKids episode. The reason we did it was we thought there was a lot of comedy potential because it was McDonalds themed. Which is true. But it’s actually pretty good as far as NES games go.

  There is nothing he can love about bad video games, as the Nerd reviews M.C. Kids for the NES, a video game based on McDonald's. 

  Released in Feb. 1992, McKids was an advert NES game from Virgin Interactive to promote McDonald's.

  You star as Mick and Mack (name inspired by 'Dick' and 'Mac' McDonald, the founders of McDonald's), two kids who travel to McDonaldland to recover Ronald McDonald's magical bag from The Hamburgler.  Along the way, you'll encounter other McDonaldland mascots including Grimace, Birdie, and CosMc.

  Even though it plays similar to Super Mario Bros. 3, there are notable differences:

  1\.  You can pick up and throw blocks.

  2\.  You can travel upside-down by running to special cogs.

  3\.  You have to collect McDonald Cards to advance to the next level.

  AVGN, while admit that it's wasn't a terrible game, noticed the level difficulty, bugs, and the slippery controls.  Oh, and don't bother trying to attack enemies with blocks...

  Note:  This episode introduced the AVGN Theme composed by Kyle Justin.  You can check his work at:
