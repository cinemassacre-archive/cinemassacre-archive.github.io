he Nerd pumps himself up for a fight, in order to prepare for reviewing the SMS video game based on Rocky. This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 16.

One of the most successful movie franchises loved by children of the 80's was Sylvester Stallone's Rocky. Starting with the first Rocky movie released in 1976, the series had a huge impact on children and adults everywhere, winning all sorts of awards and praise. So, it was only a matter of time for Rocky's success to take a punch at the home video game console market. In this video, we find the nerd going over one of the games adapted from the franchise on the Sega Master System. So, what could an Angry Video Game Nerd have to say about a game based on such a successful movie franchise? It can't be too bad, could it?
