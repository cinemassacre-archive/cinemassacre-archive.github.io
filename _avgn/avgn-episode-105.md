Today the Angry Video Game Nerd reviews Dark Castle for the Sega Genesis. This game was released in 1991 by Electronic Arts and swiftly panned by critics and gamers alike. It stars a Peter Pan-like character that appears in the entrance of a castle without any prior explanation or storyline. There are multiple doors to enter, but they're each as much of a mystery as the first. Upon entering a door, the game switches abruptly to a side-scroller which features even worse graphics than the introduction. In addition to the horrid graphics, the game plays a repetitive loop of ominous piano music which can only be deactivated with careful timing at the dawn of the game. 

These issues are considered petty when compared to the gameplay and controls that turn out to be a complete mess. The Nerd struggles with awkward button combinations and unresponsiveness to complete the simplest of tasks like ducking and throwing items. Watch as the Nerd plays, in his opinion, the worst Sega Genesis game he ever has.
