Released in 1986 by Hudson Soft. In Episode 64 the Nerd takes a look at Milon's Secret Castle, an unassuming game that seems decent on the surface.

Back when you were little you would rent a game from the store of your choice, and you happened to pick this game, a game with a castle and lighting on the cover. If you played Adventure Island, then you're probably familiar with Hudson and maybe were expecting something awesome. Instead, you play as Milon, a little dwarf thing that shoots bubbles. This game is unrelenting in it's secrets alright, and the Nerd finds out just how cryptic it can get for himself!
