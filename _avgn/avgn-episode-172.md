In this AVGN the Nerd reviews Trespasser, a Jurassic Park FPS PC game from 1998. The game was billed as a "digital sequel" to the 1997 film The Lost World: Jurassic Park, on which it is based. The game is noted for the involvement of the film's director, Steven Spielberg and actors Richard Attenborough and Minnie Driver. The ambitious game ultimately received mixed to negative reviews at the time and disappointed many reviewers. This is Angry Video Game Nerd episode 172.
