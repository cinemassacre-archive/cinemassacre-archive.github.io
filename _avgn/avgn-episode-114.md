Made by the notorious LJN, "Alien 3" for the Nintendo Entertainment System is incredibly difficult. The screen does not keep up with the action,  the A and B buttons are opposite of what they are in most games,  there is a time limit that is practically impossible to defeat and there are teases throughout the game for one-ups and items that  ARE impossible to get. If that's not enough, most of the characters are unidentifiable and most of the action in the game has little to absolutely nothing to do with the film. If that's not enough,  one James makes it through this horrendous pile of goat puke,  the payoff is less than memorable. The game doesn't even get the ending right.  It has NOTHING to do with the movie. If you want to understand the real reason why Ellen Ripley jumped to her death at the end of the film,  it was probably because she was told she would have to either play this game or die. She made the sane choice and chose the latter.
