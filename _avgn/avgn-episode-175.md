Angry Video Game Nerd (AVGN) episode 175: The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. People love this game. People say it's the greatest game for the Nintendo 64. Some say it's the best game of all time. Really? Majora's Mask is an action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. It was released in 2000 as the sixth main installment in The Legend of Zelda series and was the second to use 3D graphics. It's set in Termina, an alternate reality to Ocarina of Time's Hyrule, which is to be destroyed along with its inhabitants in three days by a giant falling moon unless the player can save it from imminent doom. But can the Nerd survive this game???
