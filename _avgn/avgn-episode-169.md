AVGN episode 169 Superman 64 Returns!

The AVGN already covered Superman for the N64 about 11 years ago. Well, it's back... with a vengeance! Superman 64 was released for Nintendo 64 in 1999. It was based off Superman The Animated Series on Kids WB. It was also coming to PlayStation. But, however, the PlayStation Version was never release. After the game came out on Nintendo 64, it became the world's Worst Video Game of all time besides E.T. for Atari 2600.
