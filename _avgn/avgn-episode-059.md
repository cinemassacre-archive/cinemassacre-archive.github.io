The CD-I was released in 1991 by Phillips. They were originally working with Nintendo to produce a CD based add-on for the Super Nintendo, but when that didn't happen, the console known as the CD-I was born. It was a massive failure, and the whole project lost the company nearly a billion dollars. Interestingly enough, after their deal fell through with Nintendo, they were still contractually allowed to use their characters for their system.

In part one of the three-part CD-I series, the Nerd takes a look at console's only Mario title: Hotel Mario. After plans to develop a sequel to Super Mario World were scrapped, this game about closing hotel doors was made. Its bland gameplay and confusing controls has given it the reputation of being one of the worst Mario games ever made.
