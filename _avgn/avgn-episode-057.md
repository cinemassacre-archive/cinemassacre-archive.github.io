Join Count Nerd for the 2008 Halloween special dedicated to all things Drac, taking us from humble beginnings of text based games to the awe and wonder that is (cough).... full motion video. This episode charts The Fanged One's miss-steps onto home consoles with 8 Reviews across multiple platforms ranging from 1980 - 1993. 'What a horrible night to have a curse' - indeed...

Did you know that the Prince of Darkness wears Reeboks? Or that he can be killed by touching dogs? Prepare to be scared when he sinks his teeth into NES educational mathematics..

This is Angry Videogame Nerd episode 57.
