It's a third outing for the Nerd against more bad games based on Ghostbusters, as he review two more made for the NES and Genesis. This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 23.

In the final installment of the three part Ghostbusters review, the Nerd reviews the NES version of the 1989 sequel to one of the biggest comedies of all time Ghostbusters 2. While the movie is considered widely to be an inferior movie, the game is actually playable unlike its predecessor. That's not saying much, however, it's still bad. No pause button?! The Nerd also reviews the surprisingly superior Sega Genesis 16-bit effort of Ghostbusters and that originality does exist. We also learn that busting ghosts is fine, but you don't wanna mess with coffee cups.The Nerd also shares his thoughts on the constantly rumoured in production Ghostbusters 3.
