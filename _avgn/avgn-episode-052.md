In this part one of two special, the Nerd dons his cowl and cape and prepares to beat back the darkness of bad video games, as he looks over a series of games based upon the dark knight himself, Batman, that were made for the Commodore 64, NES, Sega CD, Atari Lynx, SNES, Game Boy, and Genesis. This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 52.

James dresses up like Batman and reviews several video games based on the famous caped crusader of comic book and movie fame. The first game he reviews in this episode is "Batman: The Caped Crusader" for the Commodore 64, a redundant game with comic book style graphics that was published by Ocean Software in 1988. Next, he reviews the classic, stylish, addicting NES game "Batman" made by Sunsoft; "Batman Returns" for the SNES, Sega CD and Atari Lynx consoles based on the 1992 Tim Burton film of the same name; "The Adventures of Batman and Robin" based on the cartoon Batman: The Animated Series which aired on Fox from 1992 to 1995; and finally the atrocious and befuddling SNES game "Batman Forever" based on the 1995 Joel Schumacher film Batman Forever. At the end of the episode, Batman's arch-nemesis, the Joker, makes an unwanted appearance and ties the nerd up. Check out part two for the conclusion!
