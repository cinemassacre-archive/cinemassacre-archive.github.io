It's Christmas, and the Nerd spends it this year by seeing what kind of virtual sportsman he can be in Winter Games for the NES.

It's going to be a cold, rotten Christmas for The Nerd this year as he endures bleak, depressing graphics, glitch resembling animation and atrocious music. To top it all off he will attempt to make sense of some of the worst controls in video game history while the game lets him know how much he sucks the whole way through.

It's one of those games that deserves a good beating, in reality of course! Find out what The Nerd has in store for this terrible game in this episode of Angry Video Game Nerd!

This is Angry Videogame Nerd episode 84.
