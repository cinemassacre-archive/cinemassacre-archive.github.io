The Nerd finds out how deadly difficult it is to complete another bad video game, when he attempts to review Deadly Towers for the NES. This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 54

Deadly Towers for the NES was, incredibly, a hit in 1987, back when roleplaying games were harder to find. Years later, it's hard to imagine what people were thinking- this game ate it hard whether you like RPGs or not.

In fact, the Nerd hates the game so much he can't find the words to describe it- so for this special episode, he solicited comments from you, the fans, to create the only fan-written episode of AVGN.
