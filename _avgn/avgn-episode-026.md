<p class="mikes-notes">Mike's notes:</p>

– In episode 26 AVGN reviews the Sega 32. Games reviewed: Primal Rage, Doom, Virtua Fighter & Star Wars Arcade.

– During the episode the Nerd talks about buying the 32X at a flee market for two dollars and fifty cents. This is true, I was at the flee market with James. He also bought the Sega CD there as well.

The Nerd finds out what another add-on, the 32X, for the Sega Genesis is like, and tries out some of the games that were made for it, including Primal Rage and Doom. This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 26.

Released in 1994, Sega intended for this add-on to keep gamers entertained until the launch of the Sega Saturn and as a cheap entry into the 32-bit era. Sega also hoped to see the 32x increase the longevity of the aging Genesis (Mega Drive outside of North America). Today, the system is merely a curiosity and an obscure piece of gaming history. With a small library consisting of graphically improved versions of Genesis games and arcade ports along with the imminent arrival of the Sega Saturn, the 32x flopped and was discontinued roughly only two years after its launch. Though the graphics of some games were decent for the time, some games like Doom were missing content like different levels and had poor sound quality since it used the Genesis' sound chip. Many people see the 32x as the beginning of Sega's eventual downfall in the console market as third parties began to lose faith in Sega. In this Episode, the nerd picks up from where he left off with the Sega CD to look into this worthless parasite of the Sega Genesis. Just how bad is the 32x? Watch to find out.
