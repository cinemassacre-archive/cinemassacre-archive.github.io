No meditation can prepare the Nerd for his first review of a bad Xbox game, Drake of the 99 Dragons â€“ a game featuring well-made "Saturday cartoon" artwork that was intended to be the basis for a comic book series and animated show, but was foiled by its glitches, poor gameplay, controls, cutscenes, voice acting and graphics. This is Angry Videogame Nerd episode 158.
