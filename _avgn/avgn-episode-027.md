Another super hero has had a bad game made about them, so the Nerd delves in to find out just what its like to play Silver Surfer for the NES. This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 27.

Silver Surfer for the Nintendo Entertainment System was released in the United States in 1990. It was developed by Software Creations and released by Arcadia Systems. The game is based-off the Marvel Comics superhero created by Jack Kirby. 

Aside from starring in comics, prior to 1990, the Surfer had appeared as an animated character in Hanna-Barbera's Fantastic Four series. However, it wasn't until 2007 that we would see him on the big screen in theaters, starring in 'Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer'. 

In the comics, the Silver Surfer has a variety of powers and abilities including endurance, superhuman strength and the ability to manipulate the universe's ambient energy. Does any of this actually appear in the game itself? Well if you want the short answer: No. But he can fly and shoot stuff.
