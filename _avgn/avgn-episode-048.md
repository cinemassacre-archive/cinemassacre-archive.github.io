The Nerd dons his leather hat and whip, and delves into the holy grail of bad video games, as he looks at a collection of games based on the Indiana Jones film series, made for the Atari 2600, NES and SNES. This is Angry Video Game Nerd episode 48.

Indiana Jones. A pop-culture icon and legend. One of the first heroes for generations of nerds worldwide.  Originally released in 1981, Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark was a smash success. With Harrison Ford in the lead hot off the Star Wars Trilogy and George Lucas teaming up with Steven Speilberg it was a perfect storm for a phenomenon.

Naturally, the franchise would get a video game treatment to capitalize on the success of games and the movies at the time. In this installment, the Nerd reviews to Atari 2600's very cryptic and surprisingly dense Raiders of the Lost Ark game.

With the continued success of the movies the sequels also got 8 bit renditions. We also take a look at the Temple of Doom on NES, as well as the Last Crusade for NES. There is some hope as the Nerd ends with a mini-review of the SNES Indiana Jones Trilogy which finally gets the platform version right.
