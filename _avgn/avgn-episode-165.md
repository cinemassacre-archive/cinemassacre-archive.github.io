The Angry Video Game Nerd is chronologically confused about the Kingdom Hearts timeline. With Kingdom Hearts 3 on the horizon, the AVGN will explore the goofy order of the KH games. You think it's just Kingdom Hearts 1 and Kingdom Hearts 2? Guess again. There's 358/2 Days, Birth By Sleep, Dream Drop Distance, and many more. There's almost more re-releases than the games themselves. Oh, and the release order still isn't as confusing as the story line. Final Fantasy + Disney = 1 Confused Nerd

This is Angry Videogame Nerd episode 165.
