The Toxic Avenger, 'Toxie' for short, is the brainchild of Lloyd Kaufman of Troma Entertainment, who created 'The Toxic Avenger' series, 'Tromeo and Juliet', and 'Class of Nuke Em' High'.  It was low-brow, over the top, violent, and shameless; the stuff of B-movie legends that made 'The Toxic Avenger' a cult classic. Until one day, Toxie decided to premier in a children's cartoon called 'The Toxic Crusaders'.  To appeal to the children, he had to tone down the violence while putting an environmental message similar to 'Captain Planet'.  

What could be more toxic than 'The Toxic Crusaders'?  How about creating a series of games that's so toxic, it requires TWO reviewers to clean-up this monstrosity! This is AVGN Episode 111.

As a special treat from AVGN, Lloyd Kaufman makes a special appearance for this review!
