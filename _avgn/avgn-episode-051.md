Super Nerd returns, this time to save Superman from two more bad video games. Superman: The Game for the Commodore 64, and the infamous Superman 64 for the Nintendo 64. This is Angry Video Game Nerd Episode 51.

Superman 64 was released for Nintendo 64 in 1999. It was based off Superman The Animated Series on Kids WB. It was also coming to PlayStation. But, however, the PlayStation Version was never release. After the game came out on Nintendo 64, it became the world's Worst Video Game of all time besides E.T. for Atari 2600.

Lex Luthor just trap Superman's friends (Lois, Jimmy, and Professor Hamilton) into Virtual Really. Superman has no choice to enter Virtual Really to save his friends.

You play as Superman and it's your job to fly throw Rings in the first level. Then later you have to pick up cars before they run over people. Then you have to fly throw more Rings. Then you have to pick up the Police Car and carry it to the Goal. Then after that, guest what's comes after that? MORE RINGS!!!

Is this game as bad as everyone said? Is this the Worst Game of all time? Watch this episode of The Angry Video Game Nerd and find out!
